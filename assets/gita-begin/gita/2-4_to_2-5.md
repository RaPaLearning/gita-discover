अर्जुन उवाच -
कथम् भीष्ममहम् सङ्ख्ये द्रोणम् च मधुसूदन ।
इशुभिः प्रतियोत्स्यामि पूजार्हावरिसूदन ॥ ४ ॥
गुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्
श्रेयश्चर्तुम् भैक्ष्यमपीह लोके ।
हत्वार्थकामाम्स्तु गुरूनिहैव
भुन्जीय भोगान् रुधिरप्रदिग्धन् ॥ ५ ॥

`अर्जुन उवाच` `[arjuna uvAca]` Arjuna says: `अरिसूदन` `[arisUdana]` O slayer of enemies, `मधुसूदन` `[madhusUdana]` Krishna, `कथम् प्रतियोत्स्यामि` `[katham pratiyotsyAmi]` how can I challenge and fight `भीष्मम् द्रोणम् च` `[bhISmam droNam ca]` Bhishma and Drona `इशुभिः` `[izubhiH]` with my arrows `संख्ये` `[saMkhye]` in war, `पूजार्हौ` `[pUjArhau]` while they actually deserve devotion?
`इह लोके` `[iha loke]` In this world, `श्रेयः हि` `[zreyaH hi]` it is better `अहत्वा` `[ahatvA]` to refrain from killing `महानुभावान्` `[mahAnubhAvAn]` great `गुरून्` `[gurUn]` teachers `भैक्ष्यम् चर्तुम् अपि` `[bhaikSyam cartum api]` even if it means we've to beg for a living. `हत्व` `[hatva]` Having killed `गुरून्` `[gurUn]` my teachers `इहैव` `[ihaiva]` right here, `अर्थकामाम्स्तु` `[arthakAmAmstu]` even when they like to enjoy wealth, `भुन्जीय` `[bhunjIya]` how can I enjoy `भोगान्` `[bhogAn]` those pleasures, `रुधिरप्रदिग्धन्` `[rudhirapradigdhan]` which are bathed in their blood?

Again, Arjuna is overcome by the haze between rightfulness and wrongdoing. His fear arises out of friendship and pity.

He says ‘How can I kill teachers like Bhishma and Drona, who are to be respected in reality? How can I kill them, even as they are interested in enjoying the kingdom, enjoy the same wealth that seems to be drenched in their blood? How can I sit on the same seat they had occupied before?’
