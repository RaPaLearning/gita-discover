Let's now examine each of the virtues mentioned in this Shloka, which go with Self-realization.

Being ‘without a sense of superiority’ is about being without disrespect towards great people; 

Being ‘without hypocrisy’ - hypocrisy is when the path of duty is followed for the sake of gaining fame. This is about being free from the goal of achieving fame; 

Having no intention to harm anyone, either through speech, deeds or thought; 

‘Being without agitation’ is about having an unchanged attitude towards those who trouble and provoke; 

‘Consistency in thought, speech and deed’ - saying what we intend, doing what we say; 

‘Respect and adoration towards the teacher’ is about committing to respect, inquire and serve a teacher who bestows Self-awareness;

‘Cleanliness’ is the awareness of the Self - keeping the body, mind and speech fit to achieve that awareness; 

Being ‘steadfast’ in the quest for the knowledge of the Self; 

‘Self-discipline’ is to restrain the organs from subjects that are opposed to the awareness of the Self.
