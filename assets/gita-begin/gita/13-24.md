`केचित्` `[kecit]` Some `पश्यन्ति` `[pazyanti]` see `आत्मानम्` `[AtmAnam]` their Self `आत्मनि` `[Atmani]` inside themselves `आत्मना` `[AtmanA]` using their mind, `ध्यानेन` `[dhyAnena]` with focused 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
. `अन्ये` `[anye]` Others `साङ्ख्येन योगेन` `[sAGkhyena yogena]` realize it with dedication to 
[knowledge](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
. `च अपरे` `[ca apare]` Yet others realize it `कर्मयोगेन` `[karmayogena]` through 
[work without attachment](2-40.md#karmayoga)
, purely as worship to the Lord.

Some people are complete in their devotion. Such people see the Self situated in their own bodies, by bringing their mind to focus on 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 to the Lord. 

Others, who have not achieved complete devotion, prepare their minds with the technique of [
[jnAnayOga](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
] – They bring the mind to focus on the knowledge of the Self.

Yet others are unable to focus in this manner. Some are capable and yet want an easier method. Such people are famously known to practice [
[karmayOga](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
]. They work without attachment, purely as worship to the Lord. The knowledge of the Self is embedded in such work. Using this knowledge, they prepare their mind to focus on the Self.
