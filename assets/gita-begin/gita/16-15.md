आढ्योऽभिजनवान् अस्मि कोऽन्योऽस्ति सदृशो मया ।
यक्ष्ये दास्यामि मोदिष्ये इति अज्ञान विमोहिताः ॥ १५ ॥

```
`अस्मि` `[asmi]` I am `आढ्यः` `[ADhyaH]` rich, `अभिजनवान्` `[abhijanavAn]` born in a superior race. `कः अन्यः अस्ति` `[kaH anyaH asti]` Who else `सदृशः` `[sadRzaH]` compares to `मया` `[mayA]` me? `यक्ष्ये` `[yakSye]` I work hard `दास्यामि` `[dAsyAmi]` and donate wealth, `मोदिष्ये` `[modiSye]` I enjoy it `इति` `[iti]` - in this way, `अज्ञान विमोहिताः` `[ajJAna vimohitAH]` they are deluded by ignorance.

'I am rich on my own. I am born to a superior family by my good fortune. Who in this world is equal to me, with all this self-made wealth? I work hard and donate my wealth. I enjoy it myself' - they get deluded by such ignorance. 

Without acknowledging the Lord's support, they believe that they persevere, enjoy and donate on their own. This belief comes from ignorance.
