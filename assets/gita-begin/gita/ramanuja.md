# Ramanuja

<a name='ramanuja3'></a>
_Ramanuja lived in 11th century India. He propagated devotion and surrender to the Lord in his commentaries. His works are foundational to the `विशिष्टाद्वैत` `[viziStAdvaita]` school of interpreting the scriptures._

_At the age of 16, he decided to leave for Kanchi in search of higher education. He sought out a guru called Yadava Prakasha._
_Yadava and Ramanuja did not agree on the same terms of interpretation of scriptures. Yadava could not tolerate this._
_While Ramanuja tried escaping, he ran into a fowler and his wife, who guided him back to Kanchi._
_Ramanuja realized they were Narayana and Padmavati in disguise._
_At Kanchi, Ramanuja started serving in the Varadaraja temple._

## Three Promises

_In Kanchi, Ramanuja meets Mahapurna, A disciple of Yamunacharya. Mahapurna requests Ramanuja to visit his guru. Unfortunately, by the time Ramanuja could meet him, Yamunacharya had left this world._

_Yet, Ramanuja notices that 3 fingers of the guru are folded. They represented three unfulfilled wishes. Ramanuja promises to propagate devotion to the Lord, to write a commentary on the `ब्रह्मसूत्र` `[brahmasUtra]`, and to pay off the debt to Parashara. Parashara Maharshi is the author of `विश्णु पुराण` `[vizNu purANa]`, referred several times in this commentary._
_The fingers unfold and Ramanuja sets off on his journey._

## Srirangam

_Ramanuja continues to preach at Kanchi. His fame spreads far and wide. His first teacher Yadava Prakasha decided to surrender and become his disciple._
_One day, the Srivaishnavas (devotees of Lord Vishnu) came to Kanchi to take Ramanuja to their town. After long discussions between the people of Kanchi and Srirangam, Ramanuja goes to Srirangam and continues spreading knowledge._

## Om namO nArAyanAya

_In search of salvation, Ramanuja goes to Goshti Purana in Tirukotti. There, Goshti Purna tells him that the path to salvation is `ॐ नमो नारायणाय` `[Om namO nArAyanAya]`. It is the first mantra of surrender to Lord Narayana. He tells Ramanuja to keep this a secret._
_The next day, Ramanuja goes to the top of the temple and preaches `ॐ नमो नारायणाय` `[Om namO nArAyanAya]` to everyone. Seeing this, Gosthi Purna gets angry with Ramanuja. Ramanuja says, 'I am ready to be at fault, if a hundred others reach salvation'. This impresses Goshti Purana and they hug each other._ _Later, Ramanuja writes a commentary on the Brahmasutras named Sribhashya._

## Melukote

_Ramanuja had to leave Srirangam due to Srivaishnavas being ill-treated. He received a grand welcome by the Hoysala king of Karnataka. He toured the place preaching. One day, he and his disciples come across an anthill in Melukote, giving off a pleasant fragrance. After digging it, Ramanuja found a beautiful idol of Lord Narayana. He built a temple for it in Melukote and opened it to all people._

## Sanyasa

_Sanyasa is about leaving the obsession with ‘I’_

_At Srirangam, Ramanuja saw the king Dhanurdasa showing love towards his wife in public. People around him ridiculed this._
_Ramanuja appreciated his love, asking the king what he liked the most in his wife. The king replied saying that he loved his wife’s eyes._
_Ramanuja promised to show the king something which is more beautiful._
_He took the king to the temple and showed him the Lord._

_Dhanurdasa and his wife were spellbound and became disciples of Ramanuja. But, Ramanuja’s disciples did not like Dhanurdasa. Ramanuja told them to steal Dhanurdasa’s wife’s jewels at night. The disciples went at removed all the jewels from one side as the lady was asleep. Later, she turned around so that the Brahmins could take the rest of the jewels. But they ran away._
_When Dhanurdasa came home, He heard the story and told his wife, 'If you had not turned the Brahmins would have taken all the jewels. But you turned and scared them away. You still think of the jewels as your and You need to give up that thought.'_

_The disciples heard this and reported it to Ramanuja, who told them, 'See, Dhanurdasa is a true Srivaishnava as he has given up attachment towards the materialistic world. You need to learn from him.'_

_The students learn their lesson and bow to their Guru._
