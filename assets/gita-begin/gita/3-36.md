`अर्जुन उवाच` `[arjuna uvAca]` Arjuna said- `अथ` `[atha]` In that case, `वार्ष्णेय` `[vArSNeya]` O Krishna, `केन प्रयुक्तः` `[kena prayuktaH]` what is it that inspires `अयम् पुरुषः` `[ayam puruSaH]` this man `पापम् चरति` `[pApam carati]` to do harm and feel guilt, `अनिच्छन्नपि` `[anicchannapi]` even against his wishes, `बलात् नियोजित इव` `[balAt niyojita iva]` as if he is controlled by force?

Arjuna addressed Krishna: In that case, even though a person has started on the path to realizing the Self, even though he does not wish to indulge in material things, what is it that forcibly drives him to go after worldly objects, going wrong in the process?
