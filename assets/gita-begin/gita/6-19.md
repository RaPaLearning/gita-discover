यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता ।
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युन्जतो योगमात्मनः ॥ १९ ॥

`आत्मनः` `[AtmanaH]` The Self `योगिनः` `[yoginaH]` in a person who 
[works purely as worship to the Lord](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
, `यतचित्तस्य` `[yatacittasya]` who controls his consciousness, `योगम् युन्जतः` `[yogam yunjataH]` who is dedicated and focused in his quest to realize the Self `सोपमा स्मृता` `[sopamA smRtA]` is considered similar to `दीपः` `[dIpaH]` a flame `यथा नेङ्गते` `[yathA neGgate]` that stays without shaking `निवातस्थः` `[nivAtasthaH]` in a place without winds.

A flame in a place devoid of wind does not waver. It shines bright and steady. In the same way, the Self shines in a person who practices 
[works without being driven](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
, who is not interested in anything other than the Self and the Lord, who is focused in his quest to realize the Self. 

A flame unaffected by the wind is analogous to the Self that shines in the form of pure knowledge, unmoved by all other interests and desires.
