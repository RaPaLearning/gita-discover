`भारत` `[bhArata]` Arjuna, `तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` that’s why `छित्वा` `[chitvA]` you must cut off `एनम् सम्शयम्` `[enam samzayam]` this suspicion, `हृत्स्थम्` `[hRtstham]` which has taken its place in your heart `अज्ञान सम्भूतम्` `[ajJAna sambhUtam]` due to ignorance. `आत्मनः ज्ञानासिन` `[AtmanaH jJAnAsina]` Cut it off using the knowledge of the Self as a sword. `योगम् आतिष्ठ` `[yogam AtiSTha]` Having done this, follow the path of working without being driven by attachments `उत्तिष्ठ` `[uttiSTha]` and get up.

Doubts and suspicions have taken their place inside you, due to your ignorance. Cut off these doubts about the Self, using the sword of knowledge – I’ve instructed this knowledge about the Self and the path of working without being driven by attachments. Get up to follow it.
