मयि एव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिम् निवेशय ।
निवसिष्यसि मयि एव अत ऊर्ध्वम् न सम्शयः ॥ ८ ॥

```shloka-sa-hk

mayi eva mana Adhatsva mayi buddhim nivezaya |
nivasiSyasi mayi eva Ata Urdhvam na samzayaH || 8 ||

```
`आधत्स्व` `[Adhatsva]` Station `मनः` `[manaH]` the mind `मयि एव` `[mayi eva]` in Me alone. `निवेशय` `[nivezaya]` Keep `बुद्धिम्` `[buddhim]` your intentions `मयि` `[mayi]` in Me. `अतः ऊर्ध्वम्` `[ataH Urdhvam]` After that, `नवसिष्यसि` `[navasiSyasi]` you will be `मयि एव` `[mayi eva]` in Me alone, `न सम्शयः` `[na samzayaH]` there is no doubt in this.

The Lord continues – I am the ultimate goal. I am achieved easily and quickly. Station your mind in Me. Settle down in My thoughts. Make Me your intent. Resolve that I am the highest among all achievements. 

After that, you will be in Me alone - you will enter Me right after you resolve that I am the highest achievement and settle down in My thoughts.
