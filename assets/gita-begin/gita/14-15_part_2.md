```shloka-sa

तथा प्रलीनः तमसि मूढ योनिषु जायते ॥ १५ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

tathA pralInaH tamasi mUDha yoniSu jAyate || 15 ||

```
`तथा` `[tathA]` Similarly, `प्रलीनः` `[pralInaH]` a person who dies `तमसि` `[tamasi]` in 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas) `जायते` `[jAyate]` is born `मूध योनिशु` `[mUdha yonizu]` in a womb that brings ignorance.

Similarly, a person who dies with 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
 being predominant is born in ignorance - he is born in the womb of a dog or a pig for instance. In such a birth, he is unable to pursue any of the four goals - righteousness, wealth, desire or 
[liberation](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
.
