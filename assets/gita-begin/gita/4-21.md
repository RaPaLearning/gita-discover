`निराशीः` `[nirAzIH]` Without being driven by desire, `यतचित्तात्मा` `[yatacittAtmA]` keeping the mind and the consciousness under control, `त्यक्त सर्व` `[tyakta sarva]` having given up all `परिग्रहः` `[parigrahaH]` possessions, `केवलम् शारीरम् कर्म कुर्वन्` `[kevalam zArIram karma kurvan]` merely doing the work that comes from having a body, `किल्बिषम् न आप्नोति` `[kilbiSam na Apnoti]` he is not bound to his deeds.

A person who merely does the work that comes from having a body doesn’t accumulate fault and is not bound to the material world. Such work is described here: 

The phrase ‘without being driven by desire’ is about leaving all attachment towards outcomes. The phrases ‘with the mind and consciousness under control’ and ‘having given up all possessions’- they are about having only one purpose, which is to realize the Self. In this purpose, there is no attitude of possessiveness towards the world, or towards things present in the world.

This person is not obstructed by the temptation to cease activity and contemplate. He will realize the Self, merely by working without being driven by attachments (as mentioned before).
