`यत्र` `[yatra]` Where there is `कृष्णः` `[kRSNaH]` Krishna, `योगेश्वरः` `[yogezvaraH]` the Lord of being; `यत्र` `[yatra]` where there is `पार्थः` `[pArthaH]` Arjuna `धनुर्धरः` `[dhanurdharaH]` with his bow - `तत्र` `[tatra]` that is where `श्रीः` `[zrIH]` prosperity, `विजयः` `[vijayaH]` victory, `भूतिः` `[bhUtiH]` wealth `नीतिः` `[nItiH]` and ethics `ध्रुवा` `[dhruvA]` stand firm. `मम मतिः` `[mama matiH]` This is my conviction.

Krishna is the Lord of being - everything that exists as superior, inferior, conscious or non-conscious has a nature, and a state-of-being that Lord Krishna owns. His will determines the form, state and continued existence of everything else. 

Wherever there's Lord Krishna, the son of Vasudeva and his cousin Arjuna, who has taken refuge in the Lord's feet alone - that's where prosperity, victory, wealth and ethics stand firm. Sanjaya concludes - 'This is my conviction'.
