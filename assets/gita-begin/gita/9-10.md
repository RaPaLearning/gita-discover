`कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `प्रकृतिः` `[prakRtiH]` the material environment `सूयते` `[sUyate]` guides `जगत्` `[jagat]` this world `मया` `[mayA]` by My will, `सचराचरम्` `[sacarAcaram]` including everything that’s stationary and moving, `अध्यक्षेण` `[adhyakSeNa]` with My supervision. `जगत् परिवर्तते` `[jagat parivartate]` This world goes through its cycles `अनेन हेतुना हि` `[anena hetunA hi]` with this purpose itself.

In this way, My material nature guides this world in accordance with the deeds committed by conscious beings, including everything that moves and everything that doesn’t. I supervise and witness, being the one whose intention is always fulfilled.

In fact, My supervision is the reason for the Universe to run as per the deeds of all its beings. See My ownership, the realization of My every intent without flaws such as mercilessness, see me as the son of Vasudeva, see My wealth and My state of being.

`श्वेताश्वतर` `[zvetAzvatara]` , 4-9
 says: 'From the environment, the Creator makes this world. The other conscious being is trapped in delusion. Know this delusion as the effect of the environment. Know the Creator as the Supreme Lord of the universe'.
