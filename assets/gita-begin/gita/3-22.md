न मे पार्थ अस्ति कर्तव्यम् त्रिषु लोकेषु किन्चन ।
न अनवाप्तम् अवाप्तव्यम् वर्ते एव च कर्मणि ॥ २२ ॥

na me pArtha asti kartavyam triSu lokeSu kincana |

```
`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `न मे` `[na me]` I have no `किन्चन कर्तव्यम्` `[kincana kartavyam]` duties at all `त्रिषु लोकेषु` `[triSu lokeSu]` in any of the three worlds. `न` `[na]` There is nothing that `अनवाप्तम्` `[anavAptam]` I do not possess, `अवाप्तव्यम्` `[avAptavyam]` neither is there anything that I must obtain. `वर्ते एव च` `[varte eva ca]` Even then, I am always involved `कर्मणि` `[karmaNi]` in performing action.

I, Krishna, am the master of everything; I have everything that I desire; I know everything; My purpose is always fulfilled; I take any form, either that of a 
[god](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
 or of an ordinary human; I act independently according to My will in the entire universe.

There are absolutely no duties imposed on Me. Even then, I am always in action to reassure all the people of the world.
