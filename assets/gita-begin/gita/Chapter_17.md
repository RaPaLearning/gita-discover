# Chapter 17


The previous chapter made the distinction between people who comply with the Lord's instructions and those who don't. It said that the Lord's instructions in the Vedas alone are the basis of what is to be achieved and how to achieve it.

This chapter elaborates that work done without regard to the Lord's instructions is work done in vain. It explains that the imperatives in the scriptures are of three types, as appropriate to the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. This chapter also illustrates the characteristics of the Lord's instructions and what they state.

Arjuna doesn't know this fact – that work that’s not recommended by the Lord's instructions is in vain. He wants to know the effect of work done with focus and belief in its benefits.  He wants to know the result of association with qualities such as 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva) - even though the corresponding work may not be specified in the Lord's instructions.
