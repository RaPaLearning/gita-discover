`त्यक्त्वा` `[tyaktvA]` Having abandoned `कर्म फलासङ्गम्` `[karma phalAsaGgam]` attachment towards outcomes, `नित्यतृप्तो` `[nityatRpto]` being eternally content, `निराश्रयः` `[nirAzrayaH]` having no dependence `कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तः अपि` `[karmaNyabhipravRttaH api]` even while in the midst of action, `सः` `[saH]` he `नैव किन्चित् करोति` `[naiva kincit karoti]` does not make anything 
[happen](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
, indeed.

The person who works and abandons all attachment to outcomes is ‘eternally content’. Such a person is content in the eternal Self and is ‘without dependence’ - without the illusion that an unstable environment is his refuge. This person performs in the midst of the large variety of actions. Yet, he doesn’t make anything 
[happen](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
.

> Activity without attachment is the realization of the Self.



Under the guise of activity, he is involved in the pursuit of knowledge itself. That is the meaning here. In the next Shloka, again, knowledge that’s contained in activity is clarified.
