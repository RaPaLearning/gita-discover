```shloka-sa

लोकसङ्ग्रहमेवापि सम्पश्यन् कर्तुम् अर्हसि ॥ २० ॥
यद्यद् आचरति श्रेष्ठः तत्तदेवेतरो जनः ।
स यत् प्रमाणम् कुरुते लोकस्तद् अनुवर्तते ॥ २१ ॥

lokasaGgrahamevApi sampazyan kartum arhasi || 20 ||

sa yat pramANam kurute lokastad anuvartate || 21 ||

```
`अपि` `[api]` At the very least, `सम्पश्यन्` `[sampazyan]` consider `लोकसङ्ग्रहम्` `[lokasaGgraham]` the people of the world, who must be shown the correct path `कर्म एव कर्तुम् अर्हसि` `[karma eva kartum arhasi]` and work without attachment towards outcomes.

`यत् यत्` `[yat yat]` Whatever `श्रेष्ठः` `[zreSThaH]` the champion `आचरति` `[Acarati]` does, `इतरे जनः` `[itare janaH]` other people `तत् तत् एव` `[tat tat eva]` do the same. `यत्` `[yat]` Whatever `सः प्रमाणम् कुरुते` `[saH pramANam kurute]` stand he takes, `लोकः` `[lokaH]` the world `अनुवर्तते` `[anuvartate]` follows `तत्` `[tat]` that.

Even if you look at it from the perspective of the people of this world, you must initiate and involve in activity. A ‘champion’ is a person who has complete knowledge of various sciences and is famous for his deeds and accomplishments. 

People with lesser knowledge will do whatever he does. People who feel incomplete follow his activities. They follow him when he advocates something and when he takes a stand. 

Thus, the champions, famous for their distinguished learning, must involve in their profession to assure the people of this world. Otherwise those champions would be responsible for the damage suffered by people. This guilt would make them fall away from the pursuit of the Self.
