ये हि सम्स्पर्शजा भोगा दुःखयोनय एव ते ।
आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुधः ॥ २२ ॥

ye hi samsparzajA bhogA duHkhayonaya eva te |
AdyantavantaH kaunteya na teSu ramate budhaH || 22 ||

```
`कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `ये सम्स्पर्शजा भोगाः` `[ye samsparzajA bhogAH]` those enjoyments that are born out of stimuli supplied to the sense organs `ते दुःखयोनय एव` `[te duHkhayonaya eva]` will inevitably lead to difficulties. `आद्यन्तवन्तः` `[AdyantavantaH]` They have a beginning and an end. `बुधः` `[budhaH]` The person who knows their true nature `न रमते` `[na ramate]` will not indulge `तेषु` `[teSu]` in them.

Enjoyments that result when our organs come in contact with the material world will ultimately lead to difficulties. They have a beginning and an end – they are always experienced only for a limited period of time. The person who knows their true nature does not indulge in them.
