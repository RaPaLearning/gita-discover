यज्ञो दानम् तपः चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् ॥ ५ ॥

```
`यज्ञः` `[yajJaH]` Worship, `दान` `[dAna]` charity `च` `[ca]` and `तपः` `[tapaH]` discipline `पावनानि एव` `[pAvanAni eva]` are definitely purifying `मनीषिणाम्` `[manISiNAm]` for intelligent, devout people.

Actions such as worship, charity and discipline are duties that are 'purifying' for intelligent, devout people. These are the people who adore the Lord. They desire 
[Moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 and worship the Lord as long as they are alive. These actions 'purify' by destroying the effects of past deeds - effects that could hinder our complete adoration for the Lord.
