`सन्जय उवाच` `[sanjaya uvAca]` Sanjaya said - `इति` `[iti]` Thus, `अहम् अश्रूषम्` `[aham azrUSam]` I listened to `इमम् संवादम्` `[imam saMvAdam]` this conversation `वासुदेवस्य` `[vAsudevasya]` between Krishna `च` `[ca]` and `महात्मनः` `[mahAtmanaH]` the great man `अर्जुन` `[arjuna]` Arjuna. `अद्भुतम्` `[adbhutam]` It is marvelous `रोमहर्षणम्` `[romaharSaNam]` and fabulously stimulating.

This was the conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna. We know Krishna as the son of Vasudeva, and his Arjuna as his cousin, a great man with a great intellect, who has taken refuge in the feet of the Lord. 

I listened as it was spoken. It's a conversation that's marvelous and fabulously stimulating.
