विद्या विनय सम्पन्ने भाह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।

`पन्दिताः` `[panditAH]` People who know the true nature of the Self `सम दर्शिनः` `[sama darzinaH]` see equality `विद्या विनय सम्पन्ने` `[vidyA vinaya sampanne]` in a person who is endowed with knowledge and humility, `भाह्मणे` `[bhAhmaNe]` in someone who is just a Brahmin, `गवि` `[gavi]` in a cow, `हस्तिनि` `[hastini]` in an elephant, `शुनि चैव` `[zuni caiva]` even in a dog `श्वपाके च` `[zvapAke ca]` and even in a person who eats the meat of a dog.

People who know the true nature of the Self will see equality in various beings, by virtue of the Self having a form that’s pure and infinite knowledge. The various beings have unequal, disagreeable or incongruous forms – such as a person with knowledge and humility, or a mere Brahmin, or a cow, or an elephant, or even a dog or a person who eats the meat of a dog. These various forms are due to the effects of nature. It does not arise out of the nature of the Self. By virtue of having a form that’s pure and infinite knowledge, the Self is equivalent in everyone. People who have realized the true nature of the Self know this.
