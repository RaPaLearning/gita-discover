`बहवः` `[bahavaH]` Many people `माम् उपाश्रिताः` `[mAm upAzritAH]` have taken refuge in Me, `वीत राग भय क्रोधाः` `[vIta rAga bhaya krodhAH]` discarding desire, fear and anger. `मन्मयाः` `[manmayAH]` They fill Me in their minds. `ज्ञान तपसा पूताः` `[jJAna tapasA pUtAH]` They have been purified by pursuing My knowledge single-mindedly `मद्भावम् आगताः` `[madbhAvam AgatAH]` and have attained My qualities.

Many have been purified by pursuing the knowledge about the real nature of My birth, without getting distracted. They have reaped the benefits described previously. This is what the scriptures say: ‘Learned people know the nature of His birth’ 
`पुरुषसूक्त` `[puruSasUkta]`
.

In summary, The best among the wise will know the real nature of the Lord’s birth, as told in this chapter (Shlokas 5 to 9 above).
