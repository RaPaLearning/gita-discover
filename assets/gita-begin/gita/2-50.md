`बुद्धियुक्तः` `[buddhiyuktaH]` A person who works with the awareness of the Self `जहाति` `[jahAti]` will leave behind `सुकृतदुष्कृते उभे` `[sukRtaduSkRte ubhe]` both the right and the wrong `इह` `[iha]` in this life itself. `तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` Hence, `युज्यस्व` `[yujyasva]` focus on action `योगाय` `[yogAya]` for the knowledge of the Self. `योगः` `[yogaH]` Actions done with the knowledge of the Self `कौशलम्` `[kauzalam]` yield maximum prosperity `कर्मसु` `[karmasu]` among all actions.

_The word 
`कौशलम्` `[kauzalam]`
 also means skillfulness. So, you can also read this as ‘Actions done with the knowledge of the Self are the most skillful among all actions’_

> Working with an awareness of the Self brings out the best in us – the skill in our actions.



By working while being aware of the Self, a person is freed from the influence of endless rights and wrongs collected since beginning-less time. Hence, focus on your action for the sake of this awareness. 

Among all actions that are to be done, those that are done with the awareness of the Self are the best. They bring out the best in us and have the capability to yield maximum prosperity and well-being. This is 
[`बुद्धियोग` `[buddhiyoga]`](2-49.md#buddhiyOga_a_defn)
 and it comes with a lot of skill and practice.
