`अन्ये च अपि` `[anye ca api]` Yet others `यजन्तः` `[yajantaH]` worship `ज्ञान यज्ञेन` `[jJAna yajJena]` through study. `माम् उपासते` `[mAm upAsate]` They worship Me `एकत्वेन` `[ekatvena]` in the form of a single person `विश्वतो मुखम्` `[vizvato mukham]` having the universe as His form, `बहुधा` `[bahudhA]` appearing in many `पृथक्त्वेन` `[pRthaktvena]` different ways.

Other people, equally gifted, worship Me with systematic study, along with praise and other means. How do they do this? They worship Me as the Unique Person present in the form of this universe in numerous different ways. 

This is what the Lord says here- Lord Krishna Himself existed with everything conscious and non-conscious in subtle form. They were so subtle that they couldn’t even be called out by names. The Lord willed to exist with great variety. His will is always fulfilled, of course. 

He is now present with everything 
[as His body](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body) - everything conscious and non-conscious in gross, non-subtle form. This variety includes all powers, animals, humans, non-mobile things. Thinking of the Lord in this way, they worship Him.

Next, Lord Krishna says- ‘I am the One who is present with this universe as My body’.
