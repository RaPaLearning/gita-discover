लभन्ते ब्रह्म निर्वाणम् ऋषयः क्षीण कल्मषाः ।
छिन्न द्वैधा यतात्मानः सर्व भूत हिते रताः ॥ २५ ॥

`ऋषयः` `[RSayaH]` Those who are committed to the realization of the Self `छिन्न द्वैधाः` `[chinna dvaidhAH]` are free of the dualities of this world. `यतात्मानः` `[yatAtmAnaH]` They have focused their mind exclusively on the Self. `सर्व भूत हिते रताः` `[sarva bhUta hite ratAH]` They delight in the affection among all beings, `क्षीण कल्मषाः` `[kSINa kalmaSAH]` get rid of all faults that come in the way of realizing the Self `ब्रह्म निर्वाणम् लभन्ते` `[brahma nirvANam labhante]` and obtain the infinite joy present in the Lord.

The phrase ‘free of the dualities of this world’ means that people who are committed to the realization of the Self are not bound by the dualities of this world like cold and heat. They have controlled their mind to focus on the Self alone. They consider all beings to be like themselves and delight in their affection. They are the ones who see and are inclined towards realizing the Self. By living in this state, they get rid of all faults that obstruct the realization of the Self. They attain the infinite joy present in the Lord.

Next, He says that it’s very easy for people with these characteristics to realize the Self.
