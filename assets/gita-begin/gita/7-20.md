`नियताः` `[niyatAH]` Being controlled by `स्वया प्रकृत्या` `[svayA prakRtyA]` their own nature, `हृतज्ञानाः` `[hRtajJAnAH]` their knowledge taken `तैः तैः कामैः` `[taiH taiH kAmaiH]` by various desires of that nature, `प्रपद्यन्ते` `[prapadyante]` people take refuge `अन्य देवताः` `[anya devatAH]` in other powers `तम् तम् नियमम् आस्थाय` `[tam tam niyamam AsthAya]` by following various methods, in order to attain those desires.

. The knowledge about My form has been abducted by desires that have the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
