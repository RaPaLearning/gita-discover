श्री भगवान् उवाच -
मया प्रसन्नेन तवार्जुनेदम्
रूपम् परम् दर्शितम् आत्मयोगात् ।
तेजोमयम् विश्वम् अनन्तम् आद्यम्
यत् मे त्वदन्येन न दृष्ट पूर्वम् ॥ ४७ ॥

`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` The Lord said - `अर्जुन` `[arjuna]` Arjuna, `इदम् परम् रूपम्` `[idam param rUpam]` this ultimate form `दर्शितम्` `[darzitam]` was shown `तव` `[tava]` to you `मया प्रसन्नेन` `[mayA prasannena]` by Me, out of happiness. `तेजोमयम्` `[tejomayam]` It is filled with brilliance `विश्वम्` `[vizvam]` and has the universe inside it. `अनन्तम्` `[anantam]` It is without any limits. `आद्यम्` `[Adyam]` It is the origin of everything. `आत्मयोगात्` `[AtmayogAt]` You saw it by the realization of My intent. `यत् मे` `[yat me]` This form of Mine `न दृश्ट पूर्वम्` `[na dRzTa pUrvam]` has not been seen `त्वदन्येन` `[tvadanyena]` by anyone other than you.

The Lord says -

I intended to show My form to you out of happiness. By My capacity to always realize My intent, I have shown it to you, My devotee. 

Other than you, nobody has seen this form - My appearance is filled with brilliance, with the entire universe in it. It is without any beginning, mid-point or end. It is the origin of everything other than Me.

Next, the Lord says that any method that's performed without single-minded devotion is incapable of seeing Him as He really is.
