`नित्यत्वम्` `[nityatvam]` Being persistent `अध्यात्म ज्ञान` `[adhyAtma jJAna]` in the quest of Self-awareness; `चिन्तनम्` `[cintanam]` Reflection `तत्व ज्ञानार्थ` `[tatva jJAnArtha]` to realize the truth - `एतत्` `[etat]` This `ज्ञानम् इति प्रोक्तम्` `[jJAnam iti proktam]` is said to be awareness. `यत्` `[yat]` Anything `अतः अन्यथा` `[ataH anyathA]` other than this `अज्ञानम्` `[ajJAnam]` is ignorance.

Having the virtue of persistence in the quest of the Self; 

The character of ‘reflection to realize the truth’ is about dedication towards those thoughts, whose purpose is to know the true nature of everything - Such awareness leads to the discovery of the Self. 

The Lord described a set of virtues starting with [13-7](13-7.md). He began with the statement 
['being without a sense of superiority](13-7.md#virtues_amanitvam)
'. Such virtues are useful to everybody in the quest for Self-awareness.

Any work that doesn't comply with these virtues is called ignorance (for example, work done for fame and superiority, or due to attachments) - it blocks Self-awareness.

In the first Shloka of this chapter, the Lord described the Self as 'the one who is aware'. Next, He clarifies the nature of the Self along with its awareness.
