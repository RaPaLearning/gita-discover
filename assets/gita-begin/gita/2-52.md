```shloka-sa

यदा ते मोहकलिलम् बुद्धिर्व्यतितरिष्यति ।
तदा गन्तासि निर्वेदम् श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च ॥ ५२ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

yadA te mohakalilam buddhirvyatitariSyati |
tadA gantAsi nirvedam zrotavyasya zrutasya ca || 52 ||

```
`यदा` `[yadA]` When `ते` `[te]` your `बुद्धिः` `[buddhiH]` intellect `व्यतितरिष्यति` `[vyatitariSyati]` crosses over `मोहकलिलम्` `[mohakalilam]` ignorance, `तदा` `[tadA]` then, `गन्तासि` `[gantAsi]` you gain `निर्वेदम्` `[nirvedam]` complete indifference to material objects `श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च` `[zrotavyasya zrutasya ca]` as told in the following Shlokas in addition to the previous ones.

As said before, do your work with the awareness of the Self. Your intellect will cross over ignorance. Ignorance is something that gets you addicted to the limited gratification given by sensual pleasures. It prevents you from discerning the truth. This ignorance is caused by attachments towards minor material outcomes. 

When your intellect crosses over this ignorance, you will gain complete indifference to material outcomes. As I said previously, let the outcomes go. Do as I am going to say next. You will automatically free yourself of attachment.

In ([2-39](2-39.md)), it was said ‘Listen to this teaching in the form of actions, which are performed for the purpose of attaining 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
‘. The following Shloka talks about an achievement called yoga. It is a predecessor to realizing the Self and has that special knowledge built into it. It aims to get you to a higher level of being.
