```shloka-sa-hk

mA zucaH sampadam daivIm abhijAto'si pAnDava || 5 ||

```
`पान्डव` `[pAnDava]` Arjuna, `मा शुचः` `[mA zucaH]` don't worry. `अभिजातः असि` `[abhijAtaH asi]` You are born with `सम्पदम्` `[sampadam]` the property of `दैवीम्` `[daivIm]` [complying to My instructions](Chapter_16.md#deva_asura)
.

The Lord says- 'Don't worry, you are born with the asset of compliance to My instructions' 

Arjuna is called 
`पान्डव` `[pAnDava]`
 in this Shloka. That means 'Son of Pandu', a noble king.
