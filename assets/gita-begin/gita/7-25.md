नाहम् प्रकाशः सर्वस्य योग माया समावृतः ।

`योग माया समावृतः` `[yoga mAyA samAvRtaH]` Being covered by My miraculous association with a human form, `नाहम् प्रकाशः` `[nAham prakAzaH]` I am not apparent in My brilliance `सर्वस्य` `[sarvasya]` to everyone. `अयम् लोकः` `[ayam lokaH]` People of this world, `मूढः` `[mUDhaH]` being unaware, `नाभिजानाति माम्` `[nAbhijAnAti mAm]` do not know Me `अजम्` `[ajam]` as the one who is without birth, `अव्ययम्` `[avyayam]` who does not diminish in any way.

My association with a human form is miraculous. Such confinement in a human form is not natural for someone who knows everything there is to know. Underneath this miracle, My brilliance is not visible to everyone. Being unaware of Me, people of this world see My human form alone. 

Even though I am available with more power than any power of nature, with more brilliance than the Sun or any other source of energy, these people do not know Me as the one without birth and destruction, as the single cause of the entire universe, as the Lord of everything. They don't know that I have assumed a human form to enable everyone to take refuge in Me.
