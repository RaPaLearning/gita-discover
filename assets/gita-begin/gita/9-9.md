`धनन्जय` `[dhananjaya]` Arjuna, `तानि कर्माणि` `[tAni karmANi]` those deeds `माम् न निबध्नन्ति` `[mAm na nibadhnanti]` do not bind Me. `उदासीनवदासीनम् च` `[udAsInavadAsInam ca]` Being neutral, `तेषु कर्मसु असक्तम्` `[teSu karmasu asaktam]` I have no attachment towards those deeds.

The Lord continues- Yet, these actions such as the creation of the universe and its beings don't bind Me. They do not reward Me with anything. They do not result in accusations of being merciless. That's because the past deeds of conscious beings are reason for the inequalities among them. In this creation of variety, I stay without attachment, as though I am neutral.

As said in 
`वेदान्त सूत्र` `[vedAnta sUtra]` , 2-1-34:
 'In the disparity of creation, there is no mercilessness on the part of the Lord. The disparity arises due to the past deeds of the various beings'.

In 
`वेदान्त सूत्र` `[vedAnta sUtra]` , 2-1-35:
 'Variety comes from the eternal nature of the various beings and the influence of their deeds. The deeds didn’t come into being at the time of the Lord's creation'.
