> Self-awareness is an enabler to step over the [three qualities](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects).



This person is content, being aware of his Self - the Self is distinct from the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. That's how he remains as inert, unmoved by those qualities. Such a person isn’t thrown around by feelings of agitation or longing towards their effects. Considering that these qualities keep making their 
[effects](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
 happen, he remains quiet. This person is not shaken - he does not dance to their effects.
