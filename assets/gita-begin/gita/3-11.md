`भावयत` `[bhAvayata]` By adoring `देवान्` `[devAn]` the 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers) `अनेन` `[anena]` via these forms of worship, `ते देवाः` `[te devAH]` let those 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers) `वः भावयन्तु` `[vaH bhAvayantu]` nourish you. `परस्परम् भावयन्तः` `[parasparam bhAvayantaH]` By adoring each other, `अवाप्स्यथ` `[avApsyatha]` you will obtain `परम् श्रेयः` `[param zreyaH]` ultimate superiority.

These forms of worship are a means to adore the 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
. Lord Krishna continues - These 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
 are 
[My body](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
. They have Me in themselves. Perform worship. 

In [6-24](6-24_to_6-25.md), I have said ‘I alone am the enjoyer of all forms of worship and I'm the controller who gives the benefits of worship’. 

I pervade the Self in every 
[god](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
. May those 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
 be adored with your worship and give you what you expect, such as food and drink. By adoring each other in this way, you attain the highest goal- 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
.
