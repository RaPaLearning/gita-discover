## 2-26


```shloka-sa

अथ चैनम् नित्यजातम् नित्यम् वा मन्यसे मृतम् ।
तथापि त्वम् महाबाहो नैवम् शोचितुमर्हसि ॥ २६ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

atha cainam nityajAtam nityam vA manyase mRtam |
tathApi tvam mahAbAho naivam zocitumarhasi || 26 ||

```
`अथ च` `[atha ca]` In an other way, `मन्यसे` `[manyase]` if you assume that `एनम्` `[enam]` the Self `नित्यजातम्` `[nityajAtam]` is something that's always subject to birth, `वा` `[vA]` or `मन्यसे` `[manyase]` you assume that `नित्यम् मृतम्` `[nityam mRtam]` it's something that is always subject to death, `तथापि` `[tathApi]` even then, `महाबाहो` `[mahAbAho]` O powerful one, `त्वम्` `[tvam]` you `न अर्हसि` `[na arhasi]` need not `एवम् शोचितुम्` `[evam zocitum]` feel sorrow this way.

On the other hand, let’s suppose you didn’t hear the above illustrations that the Self is different from the body. Let’s say you believe the body to be your Self, recycled across births and deaths as a part of the environment. Even then it is inappropriate to feel so much sorrow. 

Creation and destruction are inevitable for the body, since it is subject to the effects of the environment by its very nature.
