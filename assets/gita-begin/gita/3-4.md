`कर्मणाम् अनारम्भात्` `[karmaNAm anArambhAt]` By avoiding the initiation of actions, `पुरुषः` `[puruSaH]` A person `न अश्नुते` `[na aznute]` will not attain `नैष्कर्म्यम्` `[naiSkarmyam]` freedom from the influence of his deeds. `संन्यसनात् एव च` `[saMnyasanAt eva ca]` Moreover, just by renunciation of the actions he has begun, `न समधिगच्छति` `[na samadhigacchati]` one does not attain `सिद्धिम्` `[siddhim]` the goal of
