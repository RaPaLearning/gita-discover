श्रेयान् स्वधर्मो विगुणः परधर्मात् स्वनुष्ठितात् ।

`स्वधर्मो` `[svadharmo]` Your own work, `विगुणः` `[viguNaH]` perhaps lacking in perfection, `श्रेयान्` `[zreyAn]` is superior `परधर्मात्` `[paradharmAt]` in comparison to work that's not yours, `सु अनुष्ठितात्` `[su anuSThitAt]` even when executed with excellence.

When you work as described before - 
[by leaving](18-4.md#letting_go)
 possessiveness, outcomes and the misconception of making things happen - it takes the form of My worship. The phrase 'your own work' is the work that can be initiated by you, in your present space.

_'your own work' means [your initiative](13-20.md#intention_initiation) - not what you or others think you should be doing; not anything that [happened](14-19.md#happenings), nor anything that’s going to._

Work that's performed in this manner takes the form of [
[karmayOga](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
]. It is activity done using your organs and is achievable by all of us, though we are constantly constrained in our environment.

Thus, your own work done in this manner, called [
[karmayOga](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
], even perhaps lacking in perfection, is superior in comparison to [
[jnAnayOga](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
], which is to be done by people who are experts in keeping their organs under control. 

The practice of 
[jnAnayOga](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
 is about having control over all of our organs. It's loaded with the possibility of mistakes due to carelessness. 

Hence, the practice of 
[activity without attachment](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
, even when imperfect, is superior to the rare, onetime achievement of perfect control over all organs.

The Lord elaborates this '
[activity without attachment](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
' again –
