`अपरे प्राणायाम परायणाः` `[apare prANAyAma parAyaNAH]` Others who pursue the regulation of their breath `नियताहाराः` `[niyatAhArAH]` regulate the intake of food `अपाने जुह्वति प्राणम्` `[apAne juhvati prANam]` and give their breath as an offering in the process of exhalation. `तथा` `[tathA]` Yet others `प्राणे अपानम्` `[prANe apAnam]` offer their breath in the process of inhalation. `अपरे` `[apare]` Others `प्राणापान गती रुद्ध्वा` `[prANApAna gatI ruddhvA]` restrict the rate of inhalation and exhalation `प्राणेषु प्राणान् जुह्वति` `[prANeSu prANAn juhvati]` and offer the activities needed for sustenance of life to those activities themselves.

Others who practice [
[karmayOga](2-40.md#karmayoga)
] achieve excellence through the technique of breath control – 
`प्राणायाम` `[prANAyAma]`
. These people are of three types: 
`पूरक` `[pUraka]` ,
`रेचक` `[recaka]`
 and 
`कुम्भक` `[kumbhaka]`
.

People who give up the intake of breath in its outflow, as an offering are called 
`पूरक` `[pUraka]`
. Those who give up the outflow in the intake are called 
`रेचक` `[recaka]`
. Those who restrict the rate of intake and outflow of breath are called 
`कुम्भक` `[kumbhaka]`
; they leave life-sustaining activities in their breath itself.

All of them regulate their intake of food as well.
