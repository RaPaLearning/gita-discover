```shloka-sa

संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखम् आप्तुम् अयोगतः ।
योगयुक्तो मुनिर् ब्रह्म न चिरेण अधिगच्छति ॥ ६ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

saMnyAsastu mahAbAho duHkham Aptum ayogataH |
yogayukto munir brahma na cireNa adhigacchati || 6 ||

```
`महाबाहो` `[mahAbAho]` Arjuna, `संन्यासः तु` `[saMnyAsaH tu]` giving up everything else to contemplate exclusively `दुःखम्` `[duHkham]` is extremely difficult `आप्तुम्` `[Aptum]` to achieve `अयोगतः` `[ayogataH]` without activity. `योगयुक्तः` `[yogayuktaH]` A person who works without being driven by desire, `मुनिः` `[muniH]` who has the intention to realize the Self, `अधिगच्छति` `[adhigacchati]` will realize `ब्रह्म` `[brahma]` the true nature of the Self `न चिरेण` `[na cireNa]` without delay.

It isn't possible to give up everything else in 
[exclusive contemplation](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
, without working independent of desire. On the other hand, a person who is intent on realizing the Self, who is focused on 
[working without being driven by desires](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
 – will easily realize the Self without delay. 

A person who attempts to contemplate the true nature of the Self exclusively would experience extreme difficulty. Due to this difficulty, he would take a very long time to realize the Self.
