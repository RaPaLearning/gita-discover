`कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `सर्व भूतानि` `[sarva bhUtAni]` all beings `यान्ति` `[yAnti]` end up `प्रकृतिम्` `[prakRtim]` in a dormant state `मामिकाम्` `[mAmikAm]` inside My body `कल्प क्षये` `[kalpa kSaye]` at the end of a 
[kalpa](4-4.md#kalpa_definition)
. `पुनः कल्पादौ` `[punaH kalpAdau]` Again, at the beginning of the next 
[kalpa](4-4.md#kalpa_definition)
, `अहम्` `[aham]` I `तानि विसृजआमि` `[tAni visRjaAmi]` create them in various forms.

All moving and stationary beings are 
[like My body](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
. At the end of a 
[kalpa](4-4.md#kalpa_definition)
, the life of Brahma, the principal engineer of the universe comes to an end. All these beings attain a state of inactivity, a state in which they cannot be distinguished by names. They end up in this state by My will. I bring them back to form again at the beginning of the next 
[kalpa](4-4.md#kalpa_definition)
.

As 
`मनु` `[manu]` , 1-5
 says: 'All this was in a state of inactivity.  He brought forth all of it from His body'

Also read in 
`सुबाल` `[subAla]` , 7:
 'For whom subtle is the body' and in 
`सुबाल` `[subAla]` , 2:
 'The subtle merges into the indestructible. That in turn merges into darkness'. In 
`अष्ट` `[aSTa]` , 2-8-9:
 'At the beginning, darkness was present without any other characteristic'.
