```shloka-sa

श्री भगवान् उवाच -
प्रकाशम् च प्रवृत्तिम् च मोहम् एव च पान्डव ।
न द्वेष्टी सम्प्रवृत्तानि न निवृत्तानि कांक्षति ॥ २२ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

zrI bhagavAn uvAca -

na dveSTI sampravRttAni na nivRttAni kAMkSati || 22 ||

```
`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` The Lord said –
`पान्डव` `[pAnDava]` Arjuna, `प्रकाशम्` `[prakAzam]` in knowledge, `प्रवृत्ति` `[pravRtti]` activity `मोहम् च` `[moham ca]` and misconception, `न द्वेष्टी` `[na dveSTI]` this person doesn’t loathe `सम्प्रवृत्तानि` `[sampravRttAni]` their presence. `निवृत्तानि` `[nivRttAni]` In their absence, `न कांक्षति` `[na kAMkSati]` he does not yearn for them either.

The three qualities have their effects - the effect of 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
 is to illuminate and discover; 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
 drives us to run behind our desires; the effect of 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
 is misunderstanding and mistakes. 

A person who has crossed over the three qualities isn’t agitated when undesirable effects happen (for instance, when he experiences a mistake due to the effect of 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
) - these effects are not his Self. 

This person doesn’t yearn for their effects either, when they are denied to him (for instance, when he is unsuccessful in learning something- the yearning for which comes from 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
) - those desires are not the Self either.
