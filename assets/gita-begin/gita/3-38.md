## 3-38


```shloka-sa

धूमेनाव्रियते वह्निः यथादर्शो मलेन च ।
यथा उल्बेन आवृतो गर्भः तथा तेन इदम् आवृतम् ॥ ३८ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

dhUmenAvriyate vahniH yathAdarzo malena ca |
yathA ulbena AvRto garbhaH tathA tena idam AvRtam || 38 ||

```
`यथा` `[yathA]` Just as `वह्निः` `[vahniH]` fire `आव्रियते` `[Avriyate]` is hidden `धूमेन` `[dhUmena]` by smoke, `च` `[ca]` and as `आदर्शः` `[AdarzaH]` a mirror `मलेन` `[malena]` is covered by dust, `यथा` `[yathA]` just as `गर्भः` `[garbhaH]` a womb `आवृतो` `[AvRto]` is concealed `उल्बेन` `[ulbena]` by the membrane surrounding the embryo, `तथा` `[tathA]` so also, `इदम्` `[idam]` all consciousness `आवृतम्` `[AvRtam]` is covered `तेन` `[tena]` by this thing called desire.

Like a fire covered by smoke, like a mirror covered by dust, like a womb concealed by a membrane surrounding the embryo, this 'desire', as described in the above Shlokas, surrounds all beings.

In the next Shloka, Lord Krishna describes the way in which desire conceals things.
