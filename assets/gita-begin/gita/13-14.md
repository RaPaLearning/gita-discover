`सर्वेन्द्रिय गुणाभासम्` `[sarvendriya guNAbhAsam]` It gives all organs their specialty, `सव्र्वेन्द्रिय विवर्जितम्` `[savrvendriya vivarjitam]` yet remains distinct from all those organs. `असक्तम्` `[asaktam]` It is free of attachment, `सर्व भृत् चैव` `[sarva bhRt caiva]` while being capable of donning any body. `निर्गुणम्` `[nirguNam]` It is free of the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
, `गुण भोक्तृ च` `[guNa bhoktR ca]` while being capable of experiencing those qualities.

The Self is the one which illuminates all organs - these organs sense, act and are involved in an experience, only if a Self is associated with them. 

The Self is capable of knowing even without the organs. When 
[freed](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 from the boundaries of the organs, the Self naturally knows everything. 

By nature, the Self is not attached to any body - not also the body of a 
[powerful god](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
. Yet, the Self is capable of donning any body, as said in 
`छान्दोग्य` `[chAndogya]` , 7-16-2:
 'When the Self is liberated, it can take one form, three forms...'

The pure Self is naturally free of the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. Yet, it is capable of experiencing the effects of those qualities.
