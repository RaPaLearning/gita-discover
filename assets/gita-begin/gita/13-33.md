`भारत` `[bhArata]` Arjuna, `यथा` `[yathA]` just as `एकः` `[ekaH]` a single `सूर्यः` `[sUryaH]` sun `प्रकाशयति` `[prakAzayati]` spreads light `कृत्स्नम् इमम् लोकम्` `[kRtsnam imam lokam]` on this entire earth, `तथा` `[tathA]` so also `क्षेत्री` `[kSetrI]` the owner of the body `प्रकाशयति` `[prakAzayati]` lights up `कृत्स्नम् क्षेत्रम्` `[kRtsnam kSetram]` the entire body.

Just as a single Sun lights up this entire solar system with its brightness, the owner of the body - the Self - lights up all external and internal organs of the body with consciousness. 

The Self is conscious. It knows - 'I exist in this body; this body is mine'. Its consciousness reaches out everywhere right from the feet to the head.

The bright Sun is distinct from the rest of the solar system, which is lit by the Sun. In the same way, the Self is distinct from the body. The qualities of the Self as the 
[knower](13-1.md#field_and_knower_of_field)
 were described. The body is known and experienced by the Self.
