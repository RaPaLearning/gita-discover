`चातुर्वर्ण्यम्` `[cAturvarNyam]` The four characteristics `मया सृष्टम्` `[mayA sRSTam]` were created by Me, `विभागशः` `[vibhAgazaH]` classifying `गुन` `[guna]` qualities `कर्म` `[karma]` and the associated work. `विद्धि` `[viddhi]` Know `माम्` `[mAm]` Me `तस्य कर्तारम्` `[tasya kartAram]` as the one who caused it. `अपि अकर्तारम्` `[api akartAram]` Even then, I am not the doer, `अव्ययम्` `[avyayam]` I remain unchanged.

The four characteristics- 
`ब्राह्मण` `[brAhmaNa]`
 spirituality, 
`क्षत्रिय` `[kSatriya]`
 administration, 
`वैश्य` `[vaizya]`
 trade, 
`शूद्र` `[zUdra]`
 service- are prominent in all beings, right from Lord Brahma down to the lowest germ in this world. This whole world was created by Me, going by the distribution of 
[qualities (sattva, rajas and tamas)](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 and the division of work according to the qualities.

The verb ‘create’ is illustrative over here. Lord Krishna is also the protector and destroyer of the universe. In this Shloka, He said- ‘Know that I caused all of this. Know also, that I am not the doer.’

How come? He answers this in the next Shloka:
