`धर्मम्` `[dharmam]` There is conduct that elevates us `च अधर्मम्` `[ca adharmam]` and there's conduct that depresses. `पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `यया` `[yayA]` the 
[intellect](18-29.md#intellect_and_resolve)
 by which `अयथावत् प्रजानाति` `[ayathAvat prajAnAti]` a person gets a distorted understanding in this matter, `एव` `[eva]` even distorting `कार्यम्` `[kAryam]` activities that must be done `अकार्यम्` `[akAryam]` and those that are forbidden `सा राजसी` `[sA rAjasI]` - such intellect is in 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
.

With the 
[intellect](18-29.md#intellect_and_resolve)
 in the quality of 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
, a person gets a distorted understanding of the two types of activities mentioned before - activities that lead to prosperity and those that achieve liberty. 

Even while focusing on prosperity or liberty, such 
[intellect](18-29.md#intellect_and_resolve)
 is misleading in terms of what must be done and what's forbidden. This brings disregard for the appropriate place and time to do those activities.
