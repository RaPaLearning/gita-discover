```
`यत् मनः` `[yat manaH]` A mind that `इन्द्रियाणाम् अनु चरताम्` `[indriyANAm anu caratAm]` follows the organs of the body `अनुविधीयते` `[anuvidhIyate]` enslaves a person to his organs. `तत्` `[tat]` Such a mind `हरति` `[harati]` abducts `अस्य प्रज्ञाम्` `[asya prajJAm]` the person’s consciousness `इव` `[iva]` like `वायुः` `[vAyuH]` the wind `नावम्` `[nAvam]` takes a boat `अम्भसि` `[ambhasi]` on the sea.

The phrase 'a mind that follows the organs of the body' is the behavior of a person who deals with this material world according to the feelings of his body. 

Though the person's intellect may be dedicated to realize the Self in its pure form, this sort of mind takes his consciousness away. It pushes him to be inclined towards sensual objects- Just as a boat that sails in the sea is driven forcefully by undesirable winds.
