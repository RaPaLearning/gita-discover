एतैर्विमुक्तः कौन्तेय तमोद्वारैः त्रिभिर्नरः ।
आचरति आत्मनः श्रेयः ततो याति पराम् गतिम् ॥ २२ ॥

`कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `नरः` `[naraH]` a person `विमुक्तः` `[vimuktaH]` frees himself `एतैः` `[etaiH]` from these `त्रिभिः` `[tribhiH]` three `तमोद्वारैः` `[tamodvAraiH]` doors of darkness `आचरति` `[Acarati]` and works `आत्मनः` `[AtmanaH]` for his own `श्रेयः` `[zreyaH]` well-being. `ततः` `[tataH]` Then, `यान्ति` `[yAnti]` he obtains `पराम्` `[parAm]` the ultimate `गतिम्` `[gatim]` goal.

Lust, anger and greed are the three doors to darkness - they give rise to unfavorable opinions about Me. A person works for his own well-being when he doesn’t need them. This person gets to know Me and engages in My favor. Then he will certainly achieve Me, the ultimate goal.

Next, the Lord describes that the disregard for His instruction is the main cause of such torment.
