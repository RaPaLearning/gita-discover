```shloka-sa

आवृतम् ज्ञानम् एतेन ज्ञानिनो नित्य वैरिणा ।
कामरूपेण कौन्तेय दुष्पूरेण अनलेन च ॥ ३९ ॥

```
`कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `ज्ञानम्` `[jJAnam]` the knowledge `ज्ञानिनः` `[jJAninaH]` of a conscious person `आवृतम्` `[AvRtam]` is hidden `एतेन` `[etena]` by this `नित्य वैरिणा` `[nitya vairiNA]` constant enemy `कामरूपेण` `[kAmarUpeNa]` called desire, `दुष्पूरेण` `[duSpUreNa]` by the longing for things that you aren’t supposed to own `अनलेन च` `[analena ca]` and by the tendency never to be satisfied.

At the core of a conscious being is knowledge. The knowledge of the Self is hidden by a constant enemy called desire, which gets us entangled in worldly pleasures. This desire clings to us due to two factors: Desire for things that we aren’t supposed to own and never being satisfied with what we have, never saying 'enough'.

What does this 'desire' use, to stay attached to a conscious being and overpower the independence of the Self? The next Shloka explains...
