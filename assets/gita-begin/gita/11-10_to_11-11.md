`देवम्` `[devam]` The Lord's form is seen `अनेक वक्त्र नयनम्` `[aneka vaktra nayanam]` With many faces and many eyes, `अनेकाद्भुत दर्शनम्` `[anekAdbhuta darzanam]` with many extraordinary sights, `अनेक दिव्याभरणम्` `[aneka divyAbharaNam]` with supreme decorations, `दिव्यानेकोद्यतायुधम्` `[divyAnekodyatAyudham]` armed with many supreme weapons, `दिव्य माल्याम्बरधरम्` `[divya mAlyAmbaradharam]` with supreme garlands and clothes, `दिव्य गन्धानुलेपयन्` `[divya gandhAnulepayan]` with supreme aroma smeared on His body, `सर्वाश्चर्यमयम्` `[sarvAzcaryamayam]` full with every wonder, `अनन्तम्` `[anantam]` endless, `विश्वतोमुखम्` `[vizvatomukham]` facing every direction in the universe.

The Lord showed His form. It has supreme luster and shines with great brilliance. It is endless and timeless - It is present during all the three stages of creation, sustenance and destruction. It is also the abode in which the entire universe is situated. 

Hence, the Lord's form cannot be determined in the constraints of space and time. It faces every direction. The Lord’s form has decorations that suit its supremacy - clothes, aromas, garlands, accessories, weapons and so on.

The great brilliance of the Lord's form, which was mentioned in this Shloka, is described specially in the next Shloka.
