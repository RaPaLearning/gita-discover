स्पर्शान् कृत्वा बहिर्बाह्यान् चक्षुश्चैव अन्तरे भ्रुवोः ।
प्राणापानौ समौ कृत्वा नासाभ्यन्तर चारिणौ ॥ २७ ॥
यतेन्द्रिय मनो बुद्धिः मुनिर्मोक्ष परायणः ।
विगतीच्छा भय क्रोधो यस्सदा मुक्त एव सः ॥ २८ ॥

`मुनिः` `[muniH]` A person having the intention to realize the Self, `मोक्ष परायणः` `[mokSa parAyaNaH]` who has 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 as his only goal, `बाह्यण् स्पर्शान्` `[bAhyaN sparzAn]` keeps external stimuli `बहिः कृत्वा` `[bahiH kRtvA]` outside `चक्षुः चैव` `[cakSuH caiva]` and the eyes focused `भ्रुवोः अन्तरे` `[bhruvoH antare]` in-between the eye-brows. `समौ कृत्वा` `[samau kRtvA]` Balancing `प्रान अपानौ` `[prAna apAnau]` inhalation and exhalation `नासाभ्यन्तर` `[nAsAbhyantara]` through the nose, `यतेन्द्रिय मनो बुद्धिः` `[yatendriya mano buddhiH]` he takes charge of his organs, mind and his intellect. `विगतीच्छा भय क्रोधः` `[vigatIcchA bhaya krodhaH]` He is beyond desire, fear and anger. `यः` `[yaH]` Such a person `सः सदा मुक्त एव` `[saH sadA mukta eva]` stays liberated from this material world.

‘Keep external stimuli outside’ is to conquer all activities of the external organs, so they aren’t dictated by desire and anger anymore. A person whose organs, mind and intellect are incapable of being out of the journey to realize the Self is freed from desire and anger.

This person has the intention to realize the Self and his only goal is to attain 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
. He is already in the state of liberation. He sits erect in a position suitable for concentrating on the Self, focusing the eyes between the eye-brows, where the nose starts, balancing inhalation and exhalation. Even when he is in the journey to reach the goal, he is already liberated – Similar to his state of being when he actually achieves the goal of 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
.

In this technique of 
[working without being driven by desire](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
, our routine and necessary activities themselves can easily be employed to realize the Self. The Lord explains this next.
