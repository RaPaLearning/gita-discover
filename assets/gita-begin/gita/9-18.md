`गतिः` `[gatiH]` The goal, `भर्ता` `[bhartA]` the bearer, `प्रभुः` `[prabhuH]` the Lord, `साक्षी` `[sAkSI]` the one who sees everything directly, `निवासः` `[nivAsaH]` a place to live in, `शरणम्` `[zaraNam]` the refuge, `सुहृत्` `[suhRt]` the well-wisher, `प्रभव प्रलय स्थानम्` `[prabhava pralaya sthAnam]` the place in which creation and destruction occur, `निधानम्` `[nidhAnam]` an investment, `बीजम्` `[bIjam]` the seed, `अव्ययम्` `[avyayam]` which does not wear out.

I am the goal - the various objectives that are to be achieved. I am the bearer - the one who carries the universe. I am the Lord who controls everything. I see everything directly. 

I am a place where people stay, such as a home. I am the refuge - the person to whom you surrender for the experience of favorable things and the avoidance of the unfavorable. I am the well-wisher that you see around you.

A place where every creation and destruction happens - that is Me. Anything that's kept as an investment, which gets created and then gets spent, that is Me. A cause that does not wear out - that's Me.
