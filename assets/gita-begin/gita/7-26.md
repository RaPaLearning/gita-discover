`अर्जुन` `[arjuna]` Arjuna, `वेदाहम्` `[vedAham]` I know `भूतानि` `[bhUtAni]` the beings `समतीतानि` `[samatItAni]` whose time has passed, `वर्तमानानि` `[vartamAnAni]` who are present now `भविष्याणि च` `[bhaviSyANi ca]` and those who will be in the future. `तु` `[tu]` However, `न कश्चन` `[na kazcana]` there isn't anyone `वेद` `[veda]` who knows `माम्` `[mAm]` Me.
