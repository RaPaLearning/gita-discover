रजसि प्रलयम् गत्वा कर्मसङ्गिषु जायते ।

```shloka-sa-hk

rajasi pralayam gatvA karmasaGgiSu jAyate |

```
`प्रलयम् गत्वा` `[pralayam gatvA]` When the body perishes `रजसि` `[rajasi]` in 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
, `जायते` `[jAyate]` the person is re-born `कर्मसङ्गिषु` `[karmasaGgiSu]` among people who are attached to activity.

If a person dies at a time when 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
 is predominant, he is born in a community that is driven to work by desire. Being born in this way, he spends his life aspiring to achieve goals such as wealth and power.
