`अस्य प्रसादे` `[asya prasAde]` In this state of tranquility, `सर्वदुःखानाम् हानिः` `[sarvaduHkhAnAm hAniH]` the destruction of all sorrow `उपजायते` `[upajAyate]` happens. `हि` `[hi]` Indeed, `बुद्धिः` `[buddhiH]` the knowledge of the Self `पर्यवतिष्ठते` `[paryavatiSThate]` will shine in a person `प्रसन्न चेथसः` `[prasanna cethasaH]` whose thoughts are clear.

Just as this person's mind attains tranquility, any sorrow associated with material attachment disappears. The ability to distinguish the Self is established in a person whose thoughts are clear, when he is free from flaws that block his realization of the Self. This way, in the tranquility of one's mind, all sorrows are destroyed.
