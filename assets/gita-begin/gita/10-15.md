`पुरुषोत्तम` `[puruSottama]` O best among men, `त्वम् एव वेत्थ` `[tvam eva vettha]` You alone know `आत्मानम्` `[AtmAnam]` Yourself `स्वयम् आत्मना` `[svayam AtmanA]` with Your own mind. `भूत भावन` `[bhUta bhAvana]` You are the origin of all beings, `भूतेश` `[bhUteza]` the controller of all beings, `देव देव` `[deva deva]` the supreme 
[power](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
, `जगत्पते` `[jagatpate]` the Lord of the universe.

Arjuna tells Krishna - 'Best among men, You know Yourself with Your own awareness. You are the One who made all beings to come into existence. You control all beings. You are the most divine, the One supreme power. 

The 
[divine forces of nature](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
 surpass others in qualities such as beauty and equanimity- qualities that we all desire. They surpass all humans, animals, birds, waterfalls, the moon and so on. You, the Lord of the universe, surpass all those divine forces in all favorable qualities.
