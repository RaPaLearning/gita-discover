`यत् तपः क्रियते` `[yat tapaH kriyate]` Discipline that's practiced `मूढ ग्राहेण` `[mUDha grAheNa]` with confused perceptions `आत्मनः पीडया` `[AtmanaH pIDayA]` to torment oneself, `वा` `[vA]` or `परस्य उत्सादनार्थम्` `[parasya utsAdanArtham]` practiced in order to put aside others `तत् उदाहृतम्` `[tat udAhRtam]` - such discipline is said to be `तामसम्` `[tAmasam]` in the quality of 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
.

People with confused perceptions do not make the right judgement. In this confusion, they apply themselves without considering the limits of their abilities. Such discipline is done for self-torment. This, along with any discipline that's meant to put aside others is said to be in the quality of 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
.

Next, the Lord goes ahead to describe the three ways in which things can be given - the three forms of charity.
