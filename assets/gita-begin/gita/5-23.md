```shloka-sa

शक्नोति इहैव यः सोढुम् प्राक् शरीर विमोक्षणात् ।
काम क्रोधोद्भवम् वेगम् स युक्तः स सुखी नरः ॥ २३ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

zaknoti ihaiva yaH soDhum prAk zarIra vimokSaNAt |
kAma krodhodbhavam vegam sa yuktaH sa sukhI naraH || 23 ||

```
`शरीर विमोक्षणात् प्राक्` `[zarIra vimokSaNAt prAk]` Before separating from the body, `यः` `[yaH]` the person who `शक्नोति` `[zaknoti]` is able to `सोढुम्` `[soDhum]` overcome `वेगम्` `[vegam]` the rush `काम क्रोधोद्भवम्` `[kAma krodhodbhavam]` born out of desire and anger, `इहैव` `[ihaiva]` while still being in this material world `सः युक्तः` `[saH yuktaH]` is the focused one. `सः सुखी नरः` `[saH sukhI naraH]` He is a fulfilled person.

While being in this world before separating from the body, still working to achieve the goal, a focused person is someone who is able to overcome the rush caused by desire and anger. He is able to do this, since he knows the joy that’s present in the experience of the Self. He deserves to experience the Self. He alone will enjoy the pure experience of the Self, after he is separated from his body.
