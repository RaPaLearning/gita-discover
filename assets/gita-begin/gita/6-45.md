## 6-45


```shloka-sa

प्रयत्नात् यतमानस्तु योगी सम्शुद्ध किल्बिषः ।
अनेक जन्म सम्सिद्धः ततो याति पराम् गतिम् ॥ ४५ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

prayatnAt yatamAnastu yogI samzuddha kilbiSaH |
aneka janma samsiddhaH tato yAti parAm gatim || 45 ||

```
`ततः` `[tataH]` Hence, `योगी` `[yogI]` a person who has set out on the path to realize the Self `याति` `[yAti]` obtains `पराम् गतिम्` `[parAm gatim]` the ultimate goal `अनेक जन्म सम्सिद्धः` `[aneka janma samsiddhaH]` accomplished over several births `प्रयत्नात् यतमानस्तु` `[prayatnAt yatamAnastu]` by persevering with efforts, `सम्शुद्ध किल्बिषः` `[samzuddha kilbiSaH]` having been cleaned of all flaws.

With the 
[greatness of yoga](6-41.md#greatness_of_yoga)
, the flaws of a person are cleaned by a fortunate collection of births. With this, he obtains a life where he perseveres with renewed efforts. 

In this way, even though a person who is on the path to realize the Self may deviate, he will definitely reach the same ultimate goal (
[Moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
).

By virtue of being focused on the ultimate goal, a person who practices 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
 is said to be better-placed than others. This is stated in the next Shloka.
