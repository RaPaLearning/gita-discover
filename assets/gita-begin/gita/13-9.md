`असक्तिः` `[asaktiH]` Not bound by attachments, `अनभिष्वङ्गः` `[anabhiSvaGgaH]` being without possessiveness `पुत्र दार गृहादिषु` `[putra dAra gRhAdiSu]` towards a son, wife or a home, `सम चित्तत्वम्` `[sama cittatvam]` having the same attitude `नित्यम्` `[nityam]` at all times, `च` `[ca]` even on `उपपत्तिषु` `[upapattiSu]` encountering `इष्ट अनिष्ट` `[iSTa aniSTa]` the favorable and the unfavorable.

Not bound by attachment to anything other than the Self; 

Fulfilling the duties towards a son, wife or home, without stepping over to become possessive about them; 

Having the same attitude at all times, even on encountering the favorable and the unfavorable - Often we intend something, after which favorable or unfavorable events 
[happen](14-19.md#happenings)
. This is about being without ecstasy or agony in those situations.

This comes from the fact that the intent is ours and the outcome is a result of our past deeds.
