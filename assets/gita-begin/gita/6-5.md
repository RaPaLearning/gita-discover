उद्धरेत् आत्मनाऽत्मानम् न आत्मानम् अवसादयेत् ।
आत्मैव हि आत्मनो बन्धुः आत्मैव रिपुरात्मनः ॥ ५ ॥

uddharet AtmanA'tmAnam na AtmAnam avasAdayet |
Atmaiva hi Atmano bandhuH Atmaiva ripurAtmanaH || 5 ||

```
`आत्मना` `[AtmanA]` With his own intent, detached from material desires, `उद्धरेत्` `[uddharet]` he needs to achieve progress `आत्मानम्` `[AtmAnam]` in his own self. `आत्मानम् न अवसादयेत्` `[AtmAnam na avasAdayet]` He must not get disheartened and give up in defeat. `आत्मैव` `[Atmaiva]` His own intention `आत्मनो बन्धुः` `[Atmano bandhuH]` is his friend. `आत्मैव` `[Atmaiva]` His intentions `आत्मनः रिपुः` `[AtmanaH ripuH]` can be his enemies.

A person must make progress in realizing his Self by his own intention to be detached from material desires. He must not distress himself by letting his mind be attracted towards things that are detrimental to his progress. 

His own intention is his friend when it helps in realizing the Self. His very intentions can be his enemies when they drive him away from this realization.
