```shloka-sa

एतान्यपि तु कर्माणि संगम् त्यक्त्वा फलानि च ।
कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितम् मतम् उत्तमम् ॥ ६ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

etAnyapi tu karmANi saMgam tyaktvA phalAni ca |
kartavyAnIti me pArtha nizcitam matam uttamam || 6 ||

```
`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `एतानि अपि तु` `[etAni api tu]` even these `कर्माणि` `[karmANi]` activities `कर्तव्यानि` `[kartavyAni]` are to be done `त्यक्त्वा` `[tyaktvA]` by leaving `संगम्` `[saMgam]` attachment `च` `[ca]` and `फलानि` `[phalAni]` expected outcomes. `इति` `[iti]` This is `मे` `[me]` my `निश्चितम्` `[nizcitam]` definite `उत्तमम् मतम्` `[uttamam matam]` and supreme opinion.

While activities such as worship, charity and discipline are purifying for devout and intelligent people, do them as a way to adore Me. Leave attachment and keep expected outcomes aside. Give up possessiveness towards those actions. 

Those who desire 
[Moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 work in this manner. Till they depart from the body, they consider their activities as My worship. This is My definite, ultimate opinion.

This Shloka said that when activities such as worship, charity and discipline are carried out, they are to be done without attachment. Next, the Lord says that routine and prescribed activities are mandatory.
