## 2-68


```shloka-sa

तस्मात् यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः ।
इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेभ्यः तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥ ६८ ॥

```

tasmAt yasya mahAbAho nigRhItAni sarvazaH |

```
`तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` Thus, `महाबाहो` `[mahAbAho]` Arjuna, `यस्य इन्द्रियाणि` `[yasya indriyANi]` the one whose organs `निगृहीतानि` `[nigRhItAni]` are controlled `सर्वशः` `[sarvazaH]` in every way `इन्द्रियार्थेभ्यः` `[indriyArthebhyaH]` while being in the midst of sensory objects- `तस्य प्रज्ञा` `[tasya prajJA]` his consciousness `प्रथिष्ठिता` `[prathiSThitA]` is steadfast.

As told before, I am an auspicious abode. The person who keeps his mind in Me - in the way I described - controls his organs while they are among sensory objects. This person alone is consciously steadfast in realizing the Self.

The next Shloka describes the state of a person who has his organs under control in this way- a person whose mind is cheerful.
