`परमेश्वर` `[paramezvara]` O Lord of everything, `यथा` `[yathA]` The way in which `त्वम् आत्थ` `[tvam Attha]` You described `आत्मानम्` `[AtmAnam]` Yourself `एवम् एतत्` `[evam etat]` is a statement of fact. `पुरुषोत्तम` `[puruSottama]` O Best Among Men, `इच्छामि` `[icchAmi]` I would like to `द्रष्टुम्` `[draSTum]` see `ते रूपम्` `[te rUpam]` Your form `ऐश्वरम्` `[aizvaram]` with Your supreme 
[might](10-19.md)
, Your ability to pervade and control everything.

You are the ultimate Lord. The way You described Yourself - I firmly believe that it is a statement of fact, ‘told as it is’. 

You are the Best Among Men, an ocean of affection towards people who have taken refuge in You. I would like to see and fully realize Your supreme 
[might](10-19.md)
, Your unique character of having lordship over the whole universe, the way in which You protect it, create and destroy it, support and nourish it. 

I desire to see Your form having all favorable qualities, ultimate in its supremacy and beauty. It is unlike anything other than Yourself.
