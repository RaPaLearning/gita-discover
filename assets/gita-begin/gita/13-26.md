```
`भरतर्षभ` `[bharatarSabha]` Arjuna, `यावत्` `[yAvat]` whenever `किन्चित् सत्त्वम्` `[kincit sattvam]` anything `जङ्गमम्` `[jaGgamam]` moving `स्थावर` `[sthAvara]` or stationary `सन्जायते` `[sanjAyate]` comes into being, `तत् विद्धि` `[tat viddhi]` know that `सम्योगात्` `[samyogAt]` it is by an association of `क्षेत्र` `[kSetra]` a body formed from the environment `क्षेत्रज्ञ` `[kSetrajJa]` and the Self.

Whenever something comes into being – for instance a human, a moving animal or a stationary plant – know that they all come into being by an association of the body and the Self. They are all born with this association. Nothing comes into being with a separate Self and a separate body.

_Of course, a liberated Self is separated from all bonds of the environment. They are eternal, they don’t 'come into being'. This Shloka is only about those who are in the cycle of coming into being._
