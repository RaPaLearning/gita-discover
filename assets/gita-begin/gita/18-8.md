```shloka-sa

दुःखम् इत्येव यत् कर्म काय क्लेश भयात् त्यजेत् ।
स कृत्वा राजसम् त्यागम् नैव त्याग फलम् लभेत् ॥ ८ ॥

duHkham ityeva yat karma kAya kleza bhayAt tyajet |
sa kRtvA rAjasam tyAgam naiva tyAga phalam labhet || 8 ||

```
`यत् कर्म` `[yat karma]` Work that's `त्यजेत्` `[tyajet]` given up `दुःखम् इति एव` `[duHkham iti eva]` just because it's difficult, `भयात्` `[bhayAt]` due to fear `काय क्लेश` `[kAya kleza]` that it would strain the body - `त्यागम् कृत्वा` `[tyAgam kRtvA]` abandoning work in this way `राजसम्` `[rAjasam]` is done in the quality of rajas. `सः` `[saH]` The person who abandons work in this way `नैव` `[naiva]` will certainly not `लभेत्` `[labhet]` gain `त्याग फलम्` `[tyAga phalam]` any benefit from such 'sacrifice'.

Even in the belief that these actions are liberating in nature, people abandon duties such as worship due to apprehensions - They are apprehensive that those activities need material, time and a lot of effort, causing strain on the body. 

In the apprehension that they wouldn't be able to sustain these activities, they give up actions while being in the quality of 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
. They try to achieve their goals by contemplating through meditation. 

They misunderstand the scriptures and miss the awareness that naturally comes from 
[letting go](18-4.md#letting_go)
. It is said in [18-31](18-31.md): 'Forcing an understanding that was never meant is in the quality of 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
'. The actions that we do and experience are never a cause of delight. Actually, the delight we experience comes from the delight of the Lord.
