`भरतसत्तम` `[bharatasattama]` Arjuna, `शृणु` `[zRNu]` listen `मे निश्चयम्` `[me nizcayam]` to My resolution `तत्र त्यागे` `[tatra tyAge]` in the meaning of 'letting go'. `हि` `[hi]` Indeed, `त्यागः` `[tyAgaH]` 'letting go' `संप्रकीर्तितः` `[saMprakIrtitaH]` is mentioned `त्रिविधः` `[trividhaH]` in three ways, `पुरुष व्याघ्र` `[puruSa vyAghra]` O man of courage!

Listen to My resolution in this matter of perplexing declarations of 'letting go'. In work that complies to the scriptures, I have explained the concept of 'letting go' in three ways - let go the outcome of action, let go of possessiveness in actions and let go of the belief that you have made it happen. 

I explained this before in [3-30](3-30.md): Fight without grief, dedicating all actions in Me, keeping your mind in the Self and the Lord, being uninterested in the fruits of action, without feeling 'it is mine'.

> Let go of outcomes and possessiveness. Don’t be the reason.



The first way is to let-go the outcome of our actions - outcomes such as comfort and enjoyment - with the conviction that 'they are not mine'. This is called 
`फल त्याग` `[phala tyAga]`
.

In terms of doing the action, it's to let-go of the belief that 'Actions are mine because their outcome is for me'. It's about letting go of possessiveness in actions. This is 
`ममता त्याग` `[mamatA tyAga]`
.

Leaving the belief that we make things happen is to let-go of the belief that the Self is the agent of actions. This is done by placing the Lord as the One who makes all actions happen. This is [kartr'tva tyAga].
