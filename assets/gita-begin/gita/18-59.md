`आश्रित्य` `[Azritya]` Standing in `अहंकारम्` `[ahaMkAram]` arrogance, `यदि` `[yadi]` if `मन्यसे` `[manyase]` you believe `न योत्स्ये` `[na yotsye]` that you will not fight, `एष` `[eSa]` this `व्यवसायः` `[vyavasAyaH]` strategy `ते` `[te]` of yours `मिथ्या` `[mithyA]` would never be reality - `प्रकृतिः` `[prakRtiH]` your environment `नियोक्ष्यति` `[niyokSyati]` would then impel `त्वाम्` `[tvAm]` you.

'Arrogance' is the belief that you are independent in determining what's good for yourself and what's not. 

If you stand in such arrogance, disregard my instruction and believe that you will not fight, then this independent strategy of yours would never be reality. That's because your environment would force you to fight. 

That means - you would be knocked off My free will and unwittingly fall into the control of your environment.
