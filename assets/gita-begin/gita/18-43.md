'Valor' is the ability to enter a battle without fear. 

'Energy' is about being undefeated by anything. 

'Resolve' is the ability to finish work that is begun, even in the face of obstacles. 

'Fitness' is the capability to deliver any activity. 

'Staying even during war' is to remain without running away, even when death is certain in war. 

'Charity' is to give with the goal of making our wealth belong to others. 

'The ability to dominate' is the ability to control everyone other than ourselves. 

…An administrator's inherent nature brings out these activities.
