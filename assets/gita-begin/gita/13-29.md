`च` `[ca]` Further, `यः पश्यति` `[yaH pazyati]` the person who sees that `कर्माणि` `[karmANi]` activities `सर्वशः क्रियमाणानि` `[sarvazaH kriyamANAni]` universally happen `प्रकृत्या एव` `[prakRtyA eva]` by the environment alone, `तथा` `[tathA]` will infer that `आत्मानम्` `[AtmAnam]` the Self `अकर्तारम्` `[akartAram]` doesn't make anything happen. `सः पश्यति` `[saH pazyati]` Such a person sees the Self in its true form.

Universally, all activities carried out are a result of 
[happenings](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
 in the environment, soaked in its 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. This was said already in [13-20](13-20.md): 'The material environment is said to be the cause of the transactions of the body, the organs and the mind'.

The person who sees that all activities are a result of the body and the environment will see the Self as pure awareness. He doesn’t see it as the one who carries out the work. Such a person is aware of the Self and sees it in true form.

This person knows that his ignorance comes out of past deeds. He also knows this ignorance to be responsible for his bond with the environment, being bound inside a body and in experiences of comfort and sorrow.

_If the Self does not carry out actions as described here, what does it do? Look back at [13-20](13-20.md) for a description of 
[what the Self does](13-20.md#self_initiates_action)._
