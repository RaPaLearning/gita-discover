`आसुराः जनाः` `[AsurAH janAH]` Those 
[who disregard My instructions](Chapter_16.md#deva_asura) `न विदुः` `[na viduH]` do not know `प्रवृत्तिम्` `[pravRttim]` exertion and achievement `निवृत्तिम् च` `[nivRttim ca]` from actions that 
[done in liberty](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
. `अपि तेषु विद्यते न` `[api teSu vidyate na]` They don't have `शौचम् च` `[zaucam ca]` a sense of cleanliness either, `न आचारः` `[na AcAraH]` nor a sense of conduct `न सत्यम्` `[na satyam]` nor do they say it 'as it is' with the aim to benefit another.

Those who disregard the 
[Lord's instructions](Chapter_16.md#deva_asura)
 do not know exertion from liberation - they don't know the achievement of prosperity from the achievement of 
[liberty](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
, described in the scriptures.

They don't have a sense of cleanliness - Here, 'cleanliness' is the qualification to perform as per the scriptures, both in appearance as well as in essence.

They don't have a sense of conduct either - the conduct required to maintain this cleanliness in both appearance and essence. An example of this conduct is the practice of 
`सन्ध्यावन्दन` `[sandhyAvandana]` ,
which involves bathing, acknowledging nature and regulating breath. It is said in [manusmr'ti], 2.22: 'The man who does not practice 
`सन्ध्यावन्दन` `[sandhyAvandana]`
 and has no cleanliness and isn’t qualified to perform'.

The word 
`सत्य` `[satya]`
 is about 'saying it as it is' - saying what we have known and inferred, saying it with an intention to benefit our listeners. People who disregard the Lord's instructions are incapable of this.
