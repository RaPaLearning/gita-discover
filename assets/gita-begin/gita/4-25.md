`अपरे योगिनः` `[apare yoginaH]` Others who practice 
[karmayOga](2-40.md#karmayoga) `दैवम् यज्ञम् एव` `[daivam yajJam eva]` worship the Lord Himself, `पर्युपासते` `[paryupAsate]` dedicating their hearts and minds. `अपरे` `[apare]` Some others `यज्ञम्` `[yajJam]` worship `यज्ञेनैव` `[yajJenaiva]` with the tools meant for worship, `उपजुह्वति` `[upajuhvati]` making offerings `ब्रह्माग्नौ` `[brahmAgnau]` in the fire of the Lord.

Among people who work without being driven by outcomes, some worship and render service to the Lord. They achieve excellence through worship alone. Yet others perform by giving offerings in the sacred fire of the Lord, using implements such as a ladle and offering various things meant for worship. They achieve excellence by reasoning that ‘The Lord is the contribution’ and ‘The Lord is the implement’. Their life is about serving, offering and worshipping the Lord.
