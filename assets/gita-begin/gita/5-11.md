कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि ।
योगिनः कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गम् त्यक्त्वा आत्म शुद्धये ॥ ११ ॥

```
`योगिनः` `[yoginaH]` People who worship Me with their activities `कर्म कुर्वन्ति` `[karma kurvanti]` do their work `कायेन` `[kAyena]` using their bodies, `मनसा` `[manasA]` their minds, `बुद्ध्या` `[buddhyA]` their intellect `केवलैः इन्द्रियैरपि` `[kevalaiH indriyairapi]` or just with their organs, `सङ्गम् त्यक्त्वा` `[saGgam tyaktvA]` while giving up attachments `आत्म शुद्धये` `[Atma zuddhaye]` to purify the Self.

People who 
[work without attachment](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
 are free of the desire for outcomes while working via their body, their mind, their intellect and their organs. In addition, they give up the expectation that good deeds will make good things happen. They carry out their work to purify the Self. This ‘purification’ is about getting rid of the limitations imposed by actions, whose effects have stuck to the Self from ancient times.
