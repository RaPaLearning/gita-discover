```shloka-sa

तस्मात् त्वम् उत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व
जित्वा शत्रून् भुङ्क्ष्व राज्यम् समृद्धम् ।
मयैव एते निहताः पूर्वमेव
निमित्त मात्रम् भव सव्यसाचिन् ॥ ३३ ॥

`तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` Given this fact, `त्वम् उत्तिष्ठ` `[tvam uttiSTha]` you must get up. `यजः लभस्व` `[yajaH labhasva]` Gain fame and honor `शत्रून् जित्वा` `[zatrUn jitvA]` by winning over your foes. `भुङ्क्ष्व` `[bhuGkSva]` Enjoy `समृद्धम् राज्यम्` `[samRddham rAjyam]` this prosperous kingdom. `एते` `[ete]` All obstacles `मयैव निहताः` `[mayaiva nihatAH]` are destroyed by Me alone. `सव्यसाचिन्` `[savyasAcin]` Arjuna, `निमित्त मात्रम् भव` `[nimitta mAtram bhava]` merely be the instrument.

Given this (The Lord's intent, mentioned in the previous Shloka), get up and fight against them. Gain fame and honor by winning over those foes. Enjoy the prosperity of this kingdom, endowed with virtue. 

These people, who have committed offence, are already killed. They are destined to die. Arjuna, merely be the instrument in their destruction. For those who are going to be destroyed by Me, be the means - in this case, assume the role of an instrument of war.

The word 
`सव्यसाचिन्` `[savyasAcin]`
 has been used to refer to Arjuna. It means a person who can arm the arrow on the bow with his left hand. In other words, it qualifies a person as being skilled in waging war with both his hands.
