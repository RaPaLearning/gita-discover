`कुरुसत्तम` `[kurusattama]` Arjuna, `अयम् लोकः नास्ति` `[ayam lokaH nAsti]` even this material world is not `अयज्ञस्य` `[ayajJasya]` for a person without worship. `अन्यः कुतः` `[anyaH kutaH]` How can he achieve anything else?

When a person doesn’t practice worship in daily life, he doesn’t find a place in this material world itself. The great forms of worship follow the practice of worship in daily life. Such a person is not successful in upholding his righteousness, nor does he achieve goals like wealth and desires, which are related to the material world.

How can he achieve the ultimate goal of 
[Moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
, which is different from all this? The goal of 
[Moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 is shown to be superior to all other goals. The phrase ‘this material world’ signifies all the goals we experience naturally.
