`ये जनाः` `[ye janAH]` The people who `पर्युपासते` `[paryupAsate]` worship Me constantly `माम् चिन्तयन्तः` `[mAm cintayantaH]` while having Me in their thoughts, `अनन्याः` `[ananyAH]` without having any other objective in mind `नित्याभियुक्तानाम्` `[nityAbhiyuktAnAm]` desire to be united with Me forever. `अहम् वहामि` `[aham vahAmi]` I take care of `तेशाम्` `[tezAm]` their `योग` `[yoga]` achievements `क्षेम` `[kSema]` and the preservation of what they have achieved.

The people described in this Shloka do not have any objective other than being united with Me forever - it is not possible for them to exist without My thought, hence they have My thought itself as their objective. These great people worship Me while keeping Me fixed in their minds as the one endowed with all great qualities and the one who has all the power. Their worship is whole and complete, without any malice. Such people desire to be united with Me forever. I take care of their achievements. Their ultimate achievement is Me. I take care of the preservation of their achievements by freeing them from the cycle of return into this material world.
