`सर्वस्य प्रियः` `[sarvasya priyaH]` Everyone’s favorite `आहारः` `[AhAraH]` food `तु अपि` `[tu api]` also `त्रिविधः भवति` `[trividhaH bhavati]` falls into three categories. `तथा` `[tathA]` Same is the case with `यज्ञ` `[yajJa]` worship, `तपः` `[tapaH]` discipline `तथा` `[tathA]` and `दानम्` `[dAnam]` charity. `शृणु` `[zRNu]` Listen `इमम् भेदम्` `[imam bhedam]` to the distinctions `तेषाम्` `[teSAm]` between them.

The favorite food of every type of being goes according to its association with the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. In this way, eating habits are of three types too. In the same way, worship is of three types, so also discipline and charity. Listen to the distinctions between them. Listen to the distinct qualities of food, thought and charity - in terms of 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
, 
[rajas](14-7.md#rajas)
 and 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
, the qualities that cause these distinctions.
