There are goals that are achieved merely through contemplation, goals that merely require you to know a little about the Self and those that only require work. The goal to realize the Self and the Lord is higher than all of them. Hence, a person who practices 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
 – who is on the path to realize the Self – is the best among people who achieve goals through penance, learning and doing things. Hence, practice 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
.
