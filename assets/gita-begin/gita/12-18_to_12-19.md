```shloka-sa

समः शत्रौ च मित्रे च तथा मान अपमानयोः ।
शीतोष्ण सुख दुःखेषु समः सङ्ग विवर्जितः ॥ १८ ॥
तुल्य निन्दा स्तुतिः मौनी सन्तुष्टो येन केनचित् ।
अनिकेतः स्थिरमतिः भक्तिमान् मे प्रियो नरः ॥ १९ ॥

`समः` `[samaH]` Being unbiased `मित्रे` `[mitre]` among friendly `शत्रौ च` `[zatrau ca]` and unfriendly people, `तथा` `[tathA]` as well as `मान` `[mAna]` in fame `अपमानयोः` `[apamAnayoH]` and disgrace; `सम` `[sama]` being consistent `सुख दुःखेषु` `[sukha duHkheSu]` in comfort and discomfort, `शीतोष्ण` `[zItoSNa]` cold and heat; `सङ्ग विवर्जितः` `[saGga vivarjitaH]` being free of attachments;
`तुल्य निन्दा स्तुतिः` `[tulya nindA stutiH]` treating praise and reprimand in the same way, `मौनी` `[maunI]` being silent, `येन केनचित् सन्तुष्टः` `[yena kenacit santuSTaH]` satisfied with whatever comes his way, `अनिकेतः` `[aniketaH]` uninterested in establishing his residence and territory; `स्थिरमतिः` `[sthiramatiH]` being with conviction - `भक्तिमान् नरः` `[bhaktimAn naraH]` this devotee `मे प्रियः` `[me priyaH]` is dear to Me.

Starting with [12-13](12-13_to_12-14.md), The Lord described the virtues of leaving hatred towards enemies and attachment to friends, along with other characteristics of a devotee. Though redundant here, the Lord emphasizes the virtue of 'being unbiased', even when in the company of desire. 

In this Shloka, the Lord states- A person who has firm conviction in the Self is not bound by needs – such as the need to ‘belong’ to a place of residence. By the same conviction, he is unbiased in situations of fame and disgrace. Such a devotee is dear to Me.

This Shloka described a person who has focus on the Self. Next, the Lord summarizes the superiority of a devotee over this person, just as He did at the beginning of this chapter.
