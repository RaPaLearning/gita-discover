`भारत` `[bhArata]` Arjuna, `भूतानि` `[bhUtAni]` living beings `अव्यक्तादीनि` `[avyaktAdIni]` are previously in a state that cannot be perceived. `व्यक्तमध्यानि` `[vyaktamadhyAni]` In-between, they can be perceived. `अव्यक्त निधनान्येव` `[avyakta nidhanAnyeva]` After death, they cannot be perceived anyway. `का परिदेवना` `[kA paridevanA]` What’s the sorrow `तत्र` `[tatra]` over there?

Living beings such as humans are not perceived in their previous state, before birth. They are perceived to exist as 'human' in the 'middle' states and are not perceivable in their succeeding state after death. They will exist as per their nature. Hence, there is no cause for sorrow. Even in the argument that the body and the Self are identical, there is no cause for sorrow. 

The Lord explained the amazing nature of the Self and clarified that it’s distinct from the body. Next, He says that it’s rare to find someone with definite knowledge of the Self, who talks about it, listens and is in line with the listening.
