`जितात्मनः` `[jitAtmanaH]` Having conquered his mind, `प्रशान्तस्य` `[prazAntasya]` a person who is at peace `परम` `[parama]` is completely `अत्मा समाहितः` `[atmA samAhitaH]` focused on the Self, which has the Lord as the basis for its existence `शीतोश्ण सुख दुःखेषु` `[zItozNa sukha duHkheSu]` in situations of cold, heat, comfort, difficulties, `तथा मान अपमानयोः` `[tathA mAna apamAnayoH]` during fame and insult too.

Having won over the mind, a person is at peace with his environment. He keeps the Self and the Lord in firm focus, irrespective of the situation – be it cold, heat, comfort, difficulties, while being famous or being insulted. The intentions of such a person do not waver. 

Since the Self is realized by such a person in its true form, it is referred to as 
`परमात्म` `[paramAtma]`
 over here – the complete Self. 

By nature, the Self has the Lord as the basis for its existence, and is totally pervaded by the Lord. Considering the previous state of such a person – he had not yet realized the Self in its true form then – we can consider him to know about the superiority of the Self now.

This person is continuously situated in the knowledge of the Self and the Lord.
