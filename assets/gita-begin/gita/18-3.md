त्याज्यम् दोषवत् इत्येके कर्म प्राहुः मनीष्णः ।
यज्ञ दान तपः कर्म न त्याज्यम् इति चापरे ॥ ३ ॥

```
`एके मनीषिणः` `[eke manISiNaH]` Some people `प्राहुः` `[prAhuH]` say that `त्याज्यम्` `[tyAjyam]` we need to leave `कर्म` `[karma]` actions, `दोषवत्` `[doSavat]` since flaws are inherent in them. `अपरे च` `[apare ca]` Others `इति` `[iti]` say that `कर्म` `[karma]` actions of `यज्ञ` `[yajJa]` worship, `दान` `[dAna]` charity `तपः` `[tapaH]` and discipline `न त्याज्यम्` `[na tyAjyam]` are not to be given up.

Some people, such as the followers of the Sage Kapila say that those who aim for 
[Moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 must let go of all activities, including the rituals that worship the Lord - That's because actions are associated with flaws that bind us, in the form of desires and expectations. Other learned people say that we must not give up these activities.
