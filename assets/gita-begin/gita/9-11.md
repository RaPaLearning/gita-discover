अवजानन्ति माम् मूढाः मानुषीम् तनुम् आश्रिताम् ।
परम् भावम् अजानन्तो मम भूत महेश्वरम् ॥ ११ ॥

`मूढाः` `[mUDhAH]` People who are deluded `अवजानन्ति माम्` `[avajAnanti mAm]` disregard Me. `अजानन्तः` `[ajAnantaH]` They do not know `मम परम् भावम्` `[mama param bhAvam]` My superior state `भूत महेश्वरम्` `[bhUta mahezvaram]` as the Lord of all beings, `मानुषीम् तनुम् आश्रिताम्` `[mAnuSIm tanum AzritAm]` the Lord who has taken a human form.

Ignorant people are deluded by the effects of their past deeds. They assume that I am a normal human being and disregard Me. 

I am in the form of a human with great compassion. This form is for everyone to take refuge in Me, while My will is always fulfilled. Being the Lord of all beings, I am the all-knowing, single cause of the universe.

The ignorant do not know Me as the Supreme Lord of all beings, situated in a limitless amount of compassion and affection. Instead, they are biased by My human appearance, thinking of Me as just another human among them. So, they disregard Me.
