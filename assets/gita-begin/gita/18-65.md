`मद्भक्तः` `[madbhaktaH]` Be My devotee `मन्मन भव` `[manmana bhava]` and keep Me in your mind. `मद्याजी` `[madyAjI]` Take initiative to worship Me. `माम् नमस्कुरु` `[mAm namaskuru]` Adore and treasure Me as superior. `मामेवैष्यसि` `[mAmevaiSyasi]` You shall certainly attain Me. `प्रतिजाने` `[pratijAne]` I affirm `सत्यम्` `[satyam]` this fact `ते` `[te]` to you. `प्रियः असि` `[priyaH asi]` You are dear `मे` `[me]` to Me.

It is said in the 
`पुरुषसूक्त` `[puruSasUkta]` -

`वेदाहम् एतम् पुरुषम् महान्तम् आदित्य वर्णम् तमसः परस्तात् । तमेवम् विद्वान् अमृत इह भवति । न अन्यः पन्था विद्यते अयनाय । ` `[vedAham etam puruSam mahAntam Aditya varNam tamasaH parastAt | tamevam vidvAn amRta iha bhavati | na anyaH panthA vidyate ayanAya | ]`

Meaning - I meditate on this supreme person, who is the color of the sun and is beyond the darkness of ignorance. Only by knowing Him, a person is free over here. There is no other path to The Goal.

Such scriptures describe the succession of the Lord's thoughts, using words such as '
[knowing](7-16.md#jnAnI)
', 'meditation' and 'worship'. It is equivalent to seeing the Lord, is very pleasant and is expressed by the directive 'keep Me in your mind'.

'Be My devotee' - The Lord directs to adore Him without limit. This directive is to keep the train of His thoughts running by means of excessive adoration. Such a train of thought is pleasant beyond comparison.

'Take initiative to worship Me' - Adoring the Lord with reverence is very joyful. Enjoy the state of being eager to worship - to be completely occupied in service.

'Adore and treasure Me as superior' - Great devotion to Me is very pleasant. So is the recognition that I am superior. Practice such devotion.

The Lord warms up: Being in this way, you shall certainly achieve Me. I affirm this fact to you. I speak the truth. I'm not saying this merely to persuade you. That's because you are very dear to Me.

It was stated in [7-17](7-17.md): 'I am dear to this 
[knowledgeable person](7-16.md#jnAnI)
, in a way that is definitely beyond description. He is dear to Me as well' - I have huge adoration for the person who adores Me a lot. Being unable to tolerate any separation from him, I will ensure that he attains Me. 

In this way, I declare that you shall achieve Me - this is a fact.
