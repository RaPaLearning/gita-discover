> Worship the Lord to experience the joy of the Self.



The Lord says ‘You will attain fulfillment by knowing Me. I am the one who enjoys worship and prayer, who is the Lord of all worlds, who is a friend and ally of all beings. You shall attain contentment trough activities that aren't driven by desire, done only to worship Me’.

The Lord is supreme among all those who control us, as said in 
`श्वेतश्वतर ६-७` `[zvetazvatara 6-7]`
. Such a Lord is also the friend and ally of everyone. Knowing Him, knowing that 
[working without being driven by desire](2-40.md#karmayoga)
 is the way to worship Him, a person will stay contented over here. Such people devote themselves to adore and worship the Lord as a friend.
