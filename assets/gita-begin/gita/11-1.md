`अर्जुन उवाच` `[arjuna uvAca]` Arjuna said - `यत् वचः` `[yat vacaH]` The teaching, which `त्वया उक्तम्` `[tvayA uktam]` You have imparted `मत् अनुग्रहाय` `[mat anugrahAya]` for my benefit, out of Love, `परमम् गुह्यम्` `[paramam guhyam]` which is supremely concealed, `अध्यात्म सन्ज्ञितम्` `[adhyAtma sanjJitam]` is the knowledge of the Self. `तेन` `[tena]` By that teaching, `मोहः अयम्` `[mohaH ayam]` this confusion of mine `विगतः` `[vigataH]` is gone.

Arjuna says - 'I was confused that my body was my Self. You have told me everything that has to be known about the Self - this knowledge is extremely concealed. 

You started imparting this knowledge, beginning with 
[2-12](2-12.md)
: 'At any point in time, it has never been that you did not exist. Even in future, there will never be a time when any one of us do not exist' up until 
[6-46](6-46.md)
 'Hence, Arjuna, practice 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
'.

You did that out of compassion, purely for my benefit. With this, all my confusion about my Self is resolved; my confusion has gone.

And -
