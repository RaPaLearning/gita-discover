```shloka-sa-hk

asau mayA hataH zatruH haniSye cAparAnapi |

```
`असौ शत्रुः` `[asau zatruH]` 'This enemy `मया हतः` `[mayA hataH]` is killed by me. `हनिष्ये` `[haniSye]` I will kill `अपरान्` `[aparAn]` others `अपि` `[api]` too'.

They say 'These enemies have been killed by me, using my strength. I will kill other enemies too, I am a daring hero. What is this imperceptible, imagined by foolish weaklings who seek its help?'
