```shloka-sa

न तु माम् शक्ष्यसे द्रष्टुम् अनेनैव स्व चक्षुषा ।
दिव्यम् ददामि ते चक्षुः पश्य मे योगम् ऐश्वरम् ॥ ८ ॥

na tu mAm zakSyase draSTum anenaiva sva cakSuSA |
divyam dadAmi te cakSuH pazya me yogam aizvaram || 8 ||

```
`तु` `[tu]` However, `न शक्ष्तसे` `[na zakStase]` you are unable `माम् द्रष्टुम्` `[mAm draSTum]` to see Me `अनेन चक्षुषा` `[anena cakSuSA]` with these eyes `स्व` `[sva]` of yours `एव` `[eva]` alone. `ददामि ते` `[dadAmi te]` I will give you `दिव्यम् चक्षुः` `[divyam cakSuH]` divine sight; `पश्य` `[pazya]` See `मम` `[mama]` My `योगम्` `[yogam]` association with all favorable qualities, `ऐश्वरम्` `[aizvaram]` My splendor and power.

While I show the entire world in one part of My body, you are unable to see My limitless being, a form unlike anything else. These material eyes of yours can only grasp matter having limited boundaries. 

I will give you divine sight - eyes that are beyond this material world, which enable you to see Me. 

See My association with all favorable qualities, My splendor and power - See My unique association with qualities like infinite knowledge, infinite power and pervasive being.
