> Adoring the Lord is special. Aspire to adore.



The practice of 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 is a duty that never perishes. This 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 is equal to the goal it achieves - The Lord Himself. People who practice devotion were described earlier in this chapter, in 
[12-2](12-2.md): ‘Those who commit their mind in Me and worship Me - they are with Me always'. 

The Lord concludes this chapter by saying- They are extremely dear to Me.
