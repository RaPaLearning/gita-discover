 he has practiced. 

He lives there for a long time, till his desires conclude. 

Finally, his desire for that kind of enjoyment fades away. Then, this person, who slipped after starting his practice of
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
 is born to a family of open and affectionate people who are endowed with good comforts – meaning, people who have initiated the practice of 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
 and who are capable of accomplishing it. 

This birth is again due to the greatness of the practice of 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
, which he has started.
