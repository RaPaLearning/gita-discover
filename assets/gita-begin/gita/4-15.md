```shloka-sa

एवम् ज्ञात्वा कृतम् कर्म पूर्वैरपि मुमुक्षुभिः ।
कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात् त्वम् पूर्वैः पूर्वतरम् कृतम् ॥ १५ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

evam jJAtvA kRtam karma pUrvairapi mumukSubhiH |
kuru karmaiva tasmAt tvam pUrvaiH pUrvataram kRtam || 15 ||

```
`एवम् ज्ञात्वा` `[evam jJAtvA]` Knowing this, `कर्म कृतम्` `[karma kRtam]` work was performed `मुमुक्षुभिः` `[mumukSubhiH]` was practiced by people who wanted 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha) `पूर्वैः अपि` `[pUrvaiH api]` generations ago. `तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` Hence, `त्वम्` `[tvam]` you `कुरु` `[kuru]` practice `पूर्वतरम्` `[pUrvataram]` this ancient and well-established `कर्म एव` `[karma eva]` way of working as well, `पूर्वैः कृतम्` `[pUrvaiH kRtam]` just as your fore-fathers had done before you.

People who sought 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 knew me in this way during ancient times. They were freed from fault and worked without attachments, in the manner 
[described before](2-40.md#karmayoga)
. In the same way, know My true form and abandon your faults too. Like Vivasvan and Manu, practice the ancient technique of working without being driven by desire- as I’ve already described previously.

In the next Shloka, He says that it’s very difficult to know the true nature of activity, the elaboration of which follows later.
