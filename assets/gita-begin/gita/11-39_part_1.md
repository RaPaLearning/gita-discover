`त्वम्` `[tvam]` You are `वायु` `[vAyu]` the wind, `यम` `[yama]` restraint, `अग्निः` `[agniH]` fire, `वरुणः` `[varuNaH]` the atmosphere, the ocean, `शशाङ्कः` `[zazAGkaH]` the moon, `प्रजापतिः` `[prajApatiH]` the leader of people, `प्रपितामहः च` `[prapitAmahaH ca]` and their great-grandfather - their origin.

You are the great-grandfather of everyone - the 'father' is the predecessor of a person. The predecessor of all beings is Brahma, the principal engineer of this universe. 

Lord, You are the predecessor of Brahma too, hence You are the great-grandfather. You are present 
[as the Self](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
 in everything. Hence, you are the One who is addressed by all their names.
