`ज्ञानावस्थित चेतसः` `[jJAnAvasthita cetasaH]` Placing his consciousness in the knowledge of the Self, `यज्ञाय आचरतः` `[yajJAya AcarataH]` performing actions for the sake of worship, `कर्मसमग्रम्` `[karmasamagram]` all the past deeds `मुक्तस्य` `[muktasya]` of a person who is free from all possessions `प्रविलीयते` `[pravilIyate]` will be destroyed without exception.

By focusing his mind on the awareness of the Self, he will lose attachment towards any other subject. He will be free from all possessions. However, the past has a binding effect. By dedicating his existence to 
[worship](3-9.md#yajna)
 the Lord with his activity, as described before, he destroys the effects of his past deeds. None of his past deeds are retained.

Next, this knowledge is described by stating that all activities and their accessories are associated with an aim to reach the Supreme Lord.
