`अर्जुन` `[arjuna]` Arjuna, `सर्गाणाम्` `[sargANAm]` all creations `अहम् आदिः` `[aham AdiH]` have Me as the beginning, `अन्तः` `[antaH]` the end `मध्यम् च` `[madhyam ca]` and everything in-between. `विद्यानाम्` `[vidyAnAm]` In all knowledge, `अध्यात्म विद्या` `[adhyAtma vidyA]` I am the fundamental knowledge about the Self, its relation to the Universe and the Lord. `प्रवदताम्` `[pravadatAm]` Among people who debate, `वादः` `[vAdaH]` I am the point that closes the argument.

The beginning of everything that's created is the cause that created them. At all times, at all places, I alone am the cause of all kinds of creation. In the same way, destruction too - at all times, the one who terminates the existence of everything is also Me. Sustenance happens in-between creation and destruction. I am the sustainer. All of this happens according to My will.

Among people who indulge in debates and arguments, I am the point that closes the argument.
