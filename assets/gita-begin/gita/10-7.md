`यः वेत्ति` `[yaH vetti]` The person who knows `एताम् मम विभूतिम्` `[etAm mama vibhUtim]` this expanse of My unlimited power `च योगम्` `[ca yogam]` and My associations - `सः` `[saH]` such a person `युज्यते` `[yujyate]` sets to work and performs `अविकम्प्येन` `[avikampyena]` with unwavering `योगेन` `[yogena]` focus and discipline. `न अत्र सम्शयः` `[na atra samzayaH]` Let there be no doubt about this.

> The Lord gifts His awareness to those who want Him.



The expanse of the Lord's unlimited power is such that the creation, state-of-being and the very existence of everything is subject to His will. 

He says- 'A person perseveres with unwavering, focused 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 when he knows My associations in their true form – I associate with great favorable qualities, I destroy all that's unfavorable. Let there be no doubt in this matter’.

He goes on to state- ‘You will see for yourself- when you are aware of My powers and the vast expanse of My favorable qualities, your 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 to Me is enhanced' - that is the opinion expressed here. 

Next, the Lord illustrates a state of 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
. We enter this state when the awareness about His qualities attains maturity.
