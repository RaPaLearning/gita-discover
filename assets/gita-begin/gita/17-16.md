`मनः प्रसादः` `[manaH prasAdaH]` A pleasant mind, `सौम्यत्वम्` `[saumyatvam]` pleased with the good fortune of others, `मौनम्` `[maunam]` keeping the organ of speech under control, `आत्म विनिग्रहः` `[Atma vinigrahaH]` stationing the mind in the object of concentration, `भाव संशुद्धिः` `[bhAva saMzuddhiH]` a clean state of being `इति एतत्` `[iti etat]` - this `उच्यते` `[ucyate]` is called as `मानसम् तपः` `[mAnasam tapaH]` the discipline of the mind.

A pleasant mind is free of anger. It is pleased with the good fortune of others. It controls the activity of speech. Such a mind concentrates on the subject that must be focused upon. A clean state of being is about letting go of thoughts that don't concern the Self. This is the discipline of the mind.
