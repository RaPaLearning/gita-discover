> Our intention leads to activity.



'Self-governance' is about performing according to our role in society and our stage in life.

Being 'free from attachment' is to let go of possessiveness towards our activity, along with their outcomes and the misconception of making things happen.

Performing without desire or hatred – This is about performing without being driven by the craving for credit, or the aversion towards discredit. It's about performance without hypocrisy.

'Not being driven by the outcome' is to avoid keeping the outcome as our purpose. It's about avoiding attachment to the outcome.

Activity that's performed in this manner, with just the simple attitude that 'It needs to be done' is said to be in the quality of
