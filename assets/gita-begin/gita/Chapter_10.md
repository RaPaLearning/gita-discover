# Chapter 10


In the previous chapter, The Lord described the art of 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
, along with its accompanying practices (worshipping and taking refuge in Him). 

This chapter works to give birth to such 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 and enhance it. Here, the Lord illustrates His limitless auspicious qualities- such as His limitless wealth, the entire 
[universe being sustained as His body](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
, His pervasiveness and His ownership.
