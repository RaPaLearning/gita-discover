The first six chapters described Krishna as the Supreme Lord and the 
[ultimate achievement](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
. To achieve Him, those chapters described 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 as a part of the Lord's worship. They also described the techniques of 
[contemplation](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
 and 
[activity](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
 as ‘means’ to achieve that devotion.  

The second set of six chapters described The Lord as the ultimate goal, His true form and His greatness. They recommended abundant and single-minded love for Him in the form of devotion. Awareness of the Lord leads to such devotion.

It was also stated that devotion is effective in achieving great wealth in this world, the curiosity to experience the Self and other goals as well.
