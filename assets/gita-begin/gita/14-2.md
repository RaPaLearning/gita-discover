`उपाश्रित्य` `[upAzritya]` Having gained `इदम् ज्ञानम्` `[idam jJAnam]` this knowledge, `आगताः` `[AgatAH]` they achieve `मम साधर्म्यम्` `[mama sAdharmyam]` My characteristics. `न उपजायन्ते` `[na upajAyante]` They are not born again `सर्गे अपि` `[sarge api]` even at the time of creation, `च` `[ca]` nor `न व्यथन्ति` `[na vyathanti]` do they perish `प्रलये` `[pralaye]` when the universe perishes.

By knowing what I’m elaborating next, people achieve My characteristics - they gain equality to Me. They are not born at the time of creation. Meaning, they remain unaffected in the act of creation. Hence, they don't perish either, remaining unaffected when the universe comes to an end. 

Each and every being that isn’t free is bound to the environment. Every such being is a combination of the environment with a Self. This was stated already in [13-26](13-26.md): 'Anything moving or stationary comes into being by an association of a Self with a body formed from the environment'. 

Beings like us are bound to the environment by the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. To explain how, the Lord starts by stating that all beings are created by His will alone.
