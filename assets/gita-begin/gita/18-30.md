> We discern with our intellect.



The endeavors of this world are for achieving prosperity. There are other endeavors to achieve the tranquility of liberation. When the 
[intellect](18-29.md#intellect_and_resolve)
 is in the quality of 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
, it knows them as they are. 

A person's profession, along with the time, place and stage of his life determine his activities to achieve prosperity and liberation. This intellect knows the activities that are prescribed and forbidden. 

Being in 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
, this intellect knows the fear that comes from going against the scriptures and the freedom from fear that comes from complying with them. 

It knows the character of this world and the cycle of bondage it brings. It also knows ‘liberty’ as the exit from this cycle.
