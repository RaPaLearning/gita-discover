```shloka-sa

अनन्त वीर्यामित विक्रमस्त्वम्
सर्वम् समाप्नोषि ततोऽसि सर्वः ॥ ४० ॥

```
`त्वम् अनन्त वीर्य` `[tvam ananta vIrya]` You have unlimited valor `अमित विक्रमः` `[amita vikramaH]` and infinite might. `समाप्नोषि` `[samApnoSi]` You pervade as the Self in everything, `ततः` `[tataH]` hence `सर्वः असि` `[sarvaH asi]` You are everything.

_‘Valor’ is the ability to perform great deeds while being unaffected as a result of doing them._

With unlimited valor, You have infinite might and are present 
[as the Self](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
 in everything. Hence You are everything. Since You pervade all conscious and non-conscious things as their Self, they are present 
[as Your body](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
. 

In this way, You alone are addressed by all words. 

It was mentioned in 
[11-37](11-37_part_2_to_11-38_part_1.md)
 ‘You are the imperishable, You are the outcome and the origin’ and in 
[11-39](11-39_part_1.md)
 ‘You are the wind, restraint, fire, the atmosphere, the ocean, the moon, the leader of people, and their great-grandfather - their origin’. You have equivalence to everything - that's because You are present as the Self in everything. This is described appropriately in 
[11-38](11-38_part_2.md)
 ‘You are the One with an unending form; the universe is pervaded by You’.
