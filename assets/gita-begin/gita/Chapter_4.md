. This was explained by the Lord in the third chapter. Hence a person needs to be active without being driven by outcomes. The path of activity is recommended even for a person who is able to focus on the Self. In particular, a person who is recognized as superior has special responsibility to stay active in this way.

In the fourth chapter, the Lord starts by saying that He imparted this knowledge to the initial beings of this world – right at the beginning – to uplift everyone. Reinforcing the need to be active, the Lord demonstrates that such activity has knowledge embedded in it. He describes the characteristics of such activity and its variety. He goes on to say that the main point of activity is knowledge. Along the way, he describes the true nature of His birth.
