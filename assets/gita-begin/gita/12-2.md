श्री भगवान् उवाच -
मय्यावेश्य मनो ये माम् नित्ययुक्ता उपासते ।
श्रद्धया परया उपेताः ते मे युक्ततमा मताः ॥ २ ॥

`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` Lord Krishna said - `ये` `[ye]` People who `माम् उपासते` `[mAm upAsate]` worship Me `मयि आवेश्य मनः` `[mayi Avezya manaH]` by committing their mind in Me `नित्य युक्त` `[nitya yukta]` are always engaged. `उपेताः` `[upetAH]` They are endowed with `परया श्रद्धया` `[parayA zraddhayA]` complete trust and dedication. `मे मता` `[me matA]` I consider `ते` `[te]` them `युक्ततमाः` `[yuktatamAH]` to be closest to Me.

The Lord commences His response- 



<a name='applnote_169'></a>
> Being devoted is to trust and be with the Lord, recognizing that He is the ultimate purpose.



People who commit their minds to Me do so with complete trust and dedication. They worship Me with extreme affection, with a desire to be with Me always. I consider such people to be closest to Me. 

Meaning- they will reach the ultimate goal easily, without delay. I am the ultimate goal.
