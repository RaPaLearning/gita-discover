```shloka-sa

यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ्क्षति ।
शुभाशुभ परित्यागी भक्तिमान् यः स मे प्रियः ॥ १७ ॥

```

yo na hRSyati na dveSTi na zocati na kAGkSati |
zubhAzubha parityAgI bhaktimAn yaH sa me priyaH || 17 ||

```
`यः` `[yaH]` Whoever `शुभ अशुभ परित्यागी` `[zubha azubha parityAgI]` leaves favorable and unfavorable experiences `न हृष्यति` `[na hRSyati]` is not ecstatic, `न द्वेष्टि` `[na dveSTi]` doesn’t hate, `न शोचति` `[na zocati]` is neither sad `न काङ्क्षति` `[na kAGkSati]` nor lustful. `यः भक्तिमान्` `[yaH bhaktimAn]` Such a devotee `स मे प्रियः` `[sa me priyaH]` is dear to Me.

Experiences that normally make humans happy do not affect a person who 
[works without attachment](2-40.md#karmayoga)
. Neither does he experience hate, when deprived of such experiences. He is not saddened even when separated from loved ones or wealth – such experiences normally cause sorrow in humans. Neither does he lust for those experiences when deprived of them. 

He has given up the distinction between the favorable and unfavorable, realizing that both good and bad perceptions are binding in nature. Such a devotee is dear to Me.
