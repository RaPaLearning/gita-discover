`व्यास प्रसादात्` `[vyAsa prasAdAt]` By the grace of Vyasa, `अहम् श्रुतवान्` `[aham zrutavAn]` I've listened to `एतत् गुह्यम्` `[etat guhyam]` this subtle, `परम् योगम्` `[param yogam]` superior practice of the Lord `कथयतः` `[kathayataH]` described `कृष्णात्` `[kRSNAt]` by Krishna, `योगेश्वरात्` `[yogezvarAt]` the Lord of the practice `स्वयम्` `[svayam]` Himself, `साक्षात्` `[sAkSAt]` as though I was present there myself.

_The word 
`योग` `[yoga]`
 here has been translated to the word 'practice'. It is the practice of recognizing things as they are. It is the practice of recognizing the Lord's infinite powers and activities. This has been explained as a ‘state of being’ in [6-20](6-20_to_6-23.md)-23 and as the Lord’s discipline and action in [10-7](10-7.md)._

Sanjaya continues - By the grace of Vyasa, I obtained divine sight and divine listening. With that, I listened to this subtle, superior practice called yoga - from the Lord of yoga Himself. 

Yoga is the practice of recognizing The Lord, who is a treasure trove of knowledge, strength, wealth, valor, power and luster. I listened as if I was there and Krishna Himself narrated it to me.
