`यत् स्थानम् प्राप्यते` `[yat sthAnam prApyate]` The state of Self-realization gained `साङ्ख्यैः` `[sAGkhyaiH]` by people who 
[contemplate exclusively](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn) `योगैरपि तत् गम्यते` `[yogairapi tat gamyate]` is also reached by people who 
[work without being driven](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
. `यः पश्यति` `[yaH pazyati]` The one who sees `साङ्ख्यम् च योगम् च` `[sAGkhyam ca yogam ca]` both of them `एकम्` `[ekam]` as one `स पश्यति` `[sa pazyati]` is the person who realizes.

Those who contemplate exclusively will reach the state of Self-realization at the end of their quest. The same Self-realization is obtained by people who work without being driven by desire. In this way, a wise person sees these two options of [
[jnAnayOga](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
] and [
[karmayOga](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
] as being the same – by virtue of having the same destination.

Next, he explains the specialty of each technique.
