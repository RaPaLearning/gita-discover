```shloka-sa

जरा मरण मोक्षाय माम् आश्रित्य यतन्ति ये ।
ते ब्रह्म तद्विदुः कृत्स्नम् अध्यात्मम् कर्म चाखिलम् ॥ २९ ॥

```
`माम् आश्रित्य` `[mAm Azritya]` Having taken My refuge, `ये` `[ye]` those who `यतन्ति` `[yatanti]` endeavor `मोक्षाय` `[mokSAya]` to gain freedom `जरा मरण` `[jarA maraNa]` from infirmity and death `ते विदुः` `[te viduH]` know `तत् ब्रह्म` `[tat brahma]` the self-existent, `कृत्स्नम् अध्यात्मम्` `[kRtsnam adhyAtmam]` the entire environment `अखिलम् कर्म च` `[akhilam karma ca]` and all activity.

_The word ‘brahma’ is translated to ‘self-existent’ here, highlighting the fact that it doesn’t need the support of its environment to exist. This is explained further in the next chapter._

The phrase 'freedom from infirmity and death' refers to the curiosity to realize the Self. This is about knowing the true nature of the Self, in a form that’s not entangled in the environment. A few people endeavor to achieve this realization in My sanctuary. They shall discern the Self, the environment and all actions in their entirety.
