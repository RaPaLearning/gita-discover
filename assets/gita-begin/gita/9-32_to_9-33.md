`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `योऽपि स्त्रियो वैश्याः तथा शूद्राः` `[yo'pi striyo vaizyAH tathA zUdrAH]` anyone, irrespective of gender and profession, `पापयोनयः स्युः` `[pApayonayaH syuH]` even those who've tread the path of malice - `तेऽपि` `[te'pi]` they will `पराम् गतिम् यान्ति हि` `[parAm gatim yAnti hi]` definitely attain the 
[supreme goal](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha) `माम् व्यपाश्रित्य` `[mAm vyapAzritya]` after taking refuge in Me.
`किम् पुनः` `[kim punaH]` It goes without saying that the same applies `पुण्याः` `[puNyAH]` to the virtuous, `भक्ताः` `[bhaktAH]` to My devotees, `ब्राह्मणाः` `[brAhmaNAH]` to those who seek to worship `तथा राजर्षयः` `[tathA rAjarSayaH]` and administrators who rule on My behalf. `भजस्व माम्` `[bhajasva mAm]` Worship Me, `प्राप्य` `[prApya]` now that you have obtained `इमम् लोकम्` `[imam lokam]` this world, `अनित्यम्` `[anityam]` which is temporary `असुखम्` `[asukham]` and is devoid of lasting joy.

> Without exception, everyone can devote themselves to the Lord.



Anyone can attain Me and reach the ultimate goal – Ladies, Gentlemen, people of various occupations, traders, those who serve other people, even those who may have tread the path of ill-will and misbehavior. It goes without saying that people who tread the path of virtue, who seek to worship Me, who administer on My behalf - they can equally take refuge by being devoted to Me. 

You, Arjuna, are here in this temporary world. It is bombarded by the three types of miseries- those inflicted by others, those inflicted by ourselves, those brought on by effects beyond our limits. Hence, it lacks peace.

You are here to administer on My behalf. Worship Me.

Next, the Lord describes the characteristics of
