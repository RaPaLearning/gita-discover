Without losing the influence of past deeds, a person wouldn’t have conquered his senses and his mind. When such a person sets out to realize the Self, he is still drawn towards sensual objects. He keeps thinking about those objects and turns away from the Self. Instead of realizing the Self, his purpose is diverted in other ways; his actions are also diverted towards other things. 

That's why such a person is said to practice in vain. Having started out to gain knowledge of the Self, he turns in the opposite direction and is wasted. That is the opinion expressed here.
