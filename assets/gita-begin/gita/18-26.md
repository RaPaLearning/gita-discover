A person who is free of attachment is not bogged down by outcomes. He doesn't claim to make things happen - he doesn't have that arrogance.

> Resolve and Enthusiasm are our state-of-being when we let-go of outcomes.



This person is endowed with resolve. Difficulties are inevitable in the journey to complete any work we’ve begun. Enduring those difficulties is called 'resolve'. 

The person is endowed with enthusiasm - it's the strong will that comes from eagerness and devotion. He is unmoved among achievements and failures - in activities such as war and in acquiring materials in the form of tools that contribute towards it. 

Such a doer is said to be in the quality of
