> How do we get to know the Lord?



In the previous chapter ([7-29](7-29.md)), it was mentioned that there are people who take the Lord’s refuge to discover the Self and get free from infirmity and death. It was mentioned that they must know the self-existent, the environment and all activity. Here, Arjuna asks- What are they?

It was also said that those who desire wealth must know this material creation, the divine agent operating inside and the purpose of worship. What are these? 

Who is the object of worship, for whose purpose we are in this body, to be known by all 
[three types of worshippers](7-28.md#three_types_of_worshippers)
? How does He stand as the object of all worship? 

In what way do the three types of worshippers know You (The Lord) when they leave their bodies?
