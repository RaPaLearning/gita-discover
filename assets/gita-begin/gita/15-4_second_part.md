`प्रपद्येत्` `[prapadyet]` You must 
[surrender](7-19.md#Sharanagati) `तम् एव` `[tam eva]` to that very `पुरुषम्` `[puruSam]` Person `यतः` `[yataH]` from whom `प्रवृत्तिः` `[pravRttiH]` all existence `प्रसृता` `[prasRtA]` came forth `पुराणी` `[purANI]` long ago.

To get rid of ignorance, we must 
[surrender](7-19.md#Sharanagati)
 to that very Person who is the origin of everything - 'that very Person' is the Lord - He described Himself in [9-10](9-10.md): ‘The material environment guides this world according to My will, I being the supreme controller’, in [10-8](10-8.md): ‘I am the origin of everything; Each and every entity gets stimulated with the initiative given by Me’ and in [7-7](7-7.md): ‘There is absolutely nothing else that is superior to Me’.

In the entire created universe, ‘binding activities’ spring forth from the Lord. These binding activities are full of the 
[three qualities](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
 and attachment to experiences. 

The fact that the Lord is the origin and that we must surrender to Him was described by the Lord Himself previously, in [7-14](7-14.md): ‘'These divine creations of Mine are pervaded by the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. They are indeed impossible to cross over. The people who 
[surrender](7-19.md#Sharanagati)
 to Me alone - they will cross over this material world’. 

There is an alternate way to read this Shloka - the syllables in [prapadyEt yata: pravr'tti:] can also be read as [prapadya iyata: pravr'tti:], which means 'By 
[surrender](7-19.md#Sharanagati)
, the full extent of achievements are possible'. With this reading, the meaning of the Shloka is:

By surrendering to that very Person who is the origin of everything, all achievements - including the freedom from ignorance - come forth in their full extent. This way of 
[surrender](7-19.md#Sharanagati)
 is ancient and has been practiced by people who desire 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
. It is in practice since 
[beginning-less time](Back-to-Basics.md#beginningless_time)
. The Lord says here - 'Since ancient times, those who desire 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 have surrendered to Me and are free from all bonds'.
