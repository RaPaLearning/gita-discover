`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `या तमसावृता` `[yA tamasAvRtA]` the 
[intellect](18-29.md#intellect_and_resolve)
 that's overwhelmed by ignorance `तामसी` `[tAmasI]` is in the quality of 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
. `सा बुद्धिः` `[sA buddhiH]` Such intellect `मन्यते` `[manyate]` considers `अधर्मम्` `[adharmam]` depressing conduct `इति` `[iti]` as `धर्मम्` `[dharmam]` upliftment. `विपरीतान् सर्वार्थानि` `[viparItAn sarvArthAni]` It brings a contrary understanding to everything.

[Intellect](18-29.md#intellect_and_resolve)
 that's in the quality of 
[tamas](14-8.md#tamas)
 is overcome by ignorance. 

It brings a contrary understanding to everything - expecting activities that depress to elevate and those that elevate to cause depression.

It considers reality as myth and believes myths to be real. 

It fosters inferior understanding and doesn't recognize anything beyond the ordinary. It considers supreme knowledge to be inferior. In this way, it has a contrary understanding of everything.
