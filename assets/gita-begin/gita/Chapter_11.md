# Chapter 11


Until now, the Lord described His presence as 
[the Self in everything](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
, along with all His favorable characteristics, all unique to Him. He did this to start our 
[association with devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 and to enhance it. 

From this, we know that the entire universe 
[is His body](7-13.md#universe_as_his_body)
, including everything that’s conscious and non-conscious. Their form, 
[state](10-4_to_10-5.md)
 and activity are subject to His will. The Lord is distinct from every other type of thing. 

Arjuna got to know these unique characteristics of the Lord from the Lord Himself. He realized that the form, state and activity of this entire universe are subject to His will. Affirming this realization, Arjuna speaks of his desire to see the Lord in such a form. The Lord is pleased and Arjuna actually sees The Lord in this form.

All this will be described in this chapter. 
[11-11](11-10_to_11-11.md)
 says- ‘The Lord is full with every wonder, endless, facing every direction in the universe’; 
[11-13](11-13.md)
 says 'Arjuna saw the entire universe, with its manifold variety there, within one place inside the body of the Lord of Lords'.
