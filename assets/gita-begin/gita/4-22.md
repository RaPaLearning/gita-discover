`यदृच्छा लाभ सन्तुष्टः` `[yadRcchA lAbha santuSTaH]` Being satisfied with whatever comes by, `द्वन्द्वातीतः` `[dvandvAtItaH]` being beyond dualities in perception (dualities such as heat and cold), `विमत्सरः` `[vimatsaraH]` being free from ill-feelings like selfishness, greed, envy, jealousy and hostility, `सिद्धौ असिद्धौ च समः` `[siddhau asiddhau ca samaH]` viewing both achievement and non-achievement of results equally, `न निबध्यते` `[na nibadhyate]` he is not bound, `कृत्वापि` `[kRtvApi]` even though he keeps performing actions.

This person’s state of being is described here. The phrases ‘he is satisfied with whatever comes by for the sustenance of the body’ and ‘he is beyond the dualities in perception’ convey that he tolerates the inevitable feelings such as heat and cold in this world, till the goal of 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 is reached.

The phrase ‘he is free from ill-feelings’ says that he has no ill-feelings towards others. He knows that the cause of any undesirable 
[happening](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
 lies in his own deeds.

Lastly, the phrase ‘he views both achievement and non-achievement of results equally’ talks about balance. Such a person has balanced feelings in activities like war, whatever be the outcome reached – victory or otherwise. This person will not come back to worldly issues, even while involving in activity, even without 
[contemplating on the Self](3-3.md#jnAnayOga_a_defn)
