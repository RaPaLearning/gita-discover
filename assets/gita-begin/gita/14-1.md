`श्री भगवान् उवाच` `[zrI bhagavAn uvAca]` Lord Krishna said - `भूयः` `[bhUyaH]` Once again, `प्रवक्ष्यामि` `[pravakSyAmi]` I will elaborate `ज्ञानम्` `[jJAnam]` the knowledge `ज्ञानानाम् उत्तमम्` `[jJAnAnAm uttamam]` that stands supreme among all there is to know. `परम्` `[param]` This description is beyond what I have said before. `यत् ज्ञात्वा` `[yat jJAtvA]` Knowing this, `सर्वे मुनयः` `[sarve munayaH]` all insightful people `गताः` `[gatAH]` have reached `पराम् सिद्धिम्` `[parAm siddhim]` the supreme goal `इतः` `[itaH]` from this material world.

The Lord says - 'What I am going to say now is beyond what I have said before'. Meaning, it is not a repetition. 

He says - 'I will elaborate the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 once again - qualities that are embedded in the environment, in which the Self is bound. This knowledge is the base for everything there is to know about the Self and its association with the environment. 

All those who gained insight from this knowledge have reached the supreme goal, crossing over this material world. Here, the supreme goal is the realization of the Self in its true form'.

In the next Shloka, the Lord describes this knowledge and the benefit of knowing it.
