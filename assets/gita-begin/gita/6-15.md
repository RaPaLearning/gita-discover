In this way, the one who practices [
[karmayOga](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
] keeps his focus on Me, the ultimate creator, the best among all beings and a favorable abode for the mind. This person fixes his mind upon Me and does not let it waver. 

Thinking about Me always, his mind has been purified by My touch – hence it stays unmoved. This person attains the ultimate joy and peace that resides in me. This joy is pure and concentrated.

In this way, the manner in which a person can begin realizing his Self was described. It was also explained how such a person can place his mind in the Lord, the ultimate purifier, who is an extremely favorable abode. Now, other instruments of this practice are described.
