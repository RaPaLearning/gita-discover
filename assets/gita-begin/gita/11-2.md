```shloka-sa

भवाप्ययौ हि भूतानाम् श्रुतौ विस्तरशो मया ।
त्वत्तः कमल पत्राक्ष माहात्म्यम् अपि चाव्ययम् ॥ २ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

bhavApyayau hi bhUtAnAm zrutau vistarazo mayA |
tvattaH kamala patrAkSa mAhAtmyam api cAvyayam || 2 ||

```
`कमल पत्राक्ष` `[kamala patrAkSa]` Krishna, You have eyes as beautiful as lotus leaves. `मया श्रुतौ हि` `[mayA zrutau hi]` I listened to `विस्तरशः` `[vistarazaH]` the elaboration `भवाप्ययौ` `[bhavApyayau]` of the creation and destruction `भूतानाम्` `[bhUtAnAm]` of all beings, `त्वत्तः` `[tvattaH]` which is brought about by You. `अपि` `[api]` I also listened to `अव्ययम्` `[avyayam]` Your unending `माहात्म्यम्` `[mAhAtmyam]` greatness.

_The phrase 
`श्रुतौ हि` `[zrutau hi]`
 over here is translated to ‘listened’. It indicates a desire to see and experience what we hear._

Further, from the seventh till the tenth chapter, I learnt that all beings are created and destroyed, other than You. All this creation and destruction happens by You. 

Lord with eyes as beautiful as lotus leaves, I listened to Your eternal control over everything conscious and non-conscious. I also listened to Your superiority, knowledge, strength and many more favorable qualities. You are the basis of all existence. You set in motion all voluntary and involuntary actions. I heard all this and more of Your unlimited greatness.

In this Shloka, the word 'listened' indicates the desire to actually see the Lord in that form. This desire is expressed in the next Shloka.
