समम् हि सर्व भूतेषु तिष्ठन्तम् परमेश्वरम् ।
विनश्यत्सु अविनश्यन्तम् यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥ २७ ॥

`परमेश्वरम्` `[paramezvaram]` The controller of the body `तिष्ठन्तम्` `[tiSThantam]` is situated `सर्व भूतेषु` `[sarva bhUteSu]` in all beings `समम्` `[samam]` in the same way. `यः पश्यति` `[yaH pazyati]` The person who sees it `अविनश्यन्तम्` `[avinazyantam]` as permanent `विनश्यत्सु` `[vinazyatsu]` among the perishable `स पश्यति` `[sa pazyati]` sees and realizes the Self.

In this way, a Self and a body, though distinct, come together to form every thing. A huge variety of things are formed and each being is unique. 

In all beings, the Self is situated as the owner of the body, the organs and the mind. It has the same characteristic in all of them - the character of infinite knowledge and unbounded joy.

Though all beings perish, the Self inside them is indestructible by nature. 

When we see this Self as equal in everyone, we see it as the one that does not perish – though it’s inside a perishable body. We see the Self in its true form.

On the other hand, a person who sees the Self in different forms inside the different forms of beings, who considers the Self as being subject to birth and death will constantly be trapped in the material world.
