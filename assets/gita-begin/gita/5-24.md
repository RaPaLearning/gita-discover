`यः` `[yaH]` The person who `अन्तस्सुखः` `[antassukhaH]` is content with his Self, `अन्तरारामः` `[antarArAmaH]` who delights in his Self, `तथा यः` `[tathA yaH]` and the one who `अन्तर्ज्योतिः एव` `[antarjyotiH eva]` is illuminated from the inside `सः ब्रह्म भूतः योगी` `[saH brahma bhUtaH yogI]` works without attachment while being situated in his Self. `ब्रह्म निर्वाणम् अधिगच्छति` `[brahma nirvANam adhigacchati]` He will attain the infinite joy present in the Self and the Lord.

The person described over here has given up all indulgence in external stimuli. He is ‘content with his Self’ – he has the experience of the Self alone as his fulfillment. He ‘delights in his Self'’ – The Self is a source of pleasure for him, instead of deriving pleasure as dictated by his 
[qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
.  He is someone who is ‘illuminated from the inside’ – he is situated in the knowledge of the Self alone.

Such a person works purely as worship to the Lord, free from attachments, while being situated in the Self. He will attain the infinite joy present in the Self and the Lord.
