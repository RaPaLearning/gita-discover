```shloka-sa

इष्टान् भोगान् हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः ।

`यज्ञभाविताः` `[yajJabhAvitAH]` Pleased by worship, `देवाः` `[devAH]` the 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers) `दास्यन्ते हि` `[dAsyante hi]` will eventually give `वः` `[vaH]` you `इष्टान् भोगान्` `[iSTAn bhogAn]` the enjoyment you wish for. `यः` `[yaH]` The person who `भुंक्ते` `[bhuMkte]` enjoys `तैः दत्तान्` `[taiH dattAn]` the benefits given by them `एभ्यः अप्रदाय` `[ebhyaH apradAya]` without giving it back `सः स्तेन एव` `[saH stena eva]` is definitely a thief.

'Pleased by worship'- Being adored through worship performed previously, the 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
, in whom I am present, will give you the enjoyment you wish for- That enjoyment, which is wished by people who strive for the ultimate goal of 
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
. They fulfil your expectations for the worship you perform. 

The person who employs the expected outcomes for pleasing himself is indeed a thief. Such a person considers them his own and avoids giving anything back. Considering something that belongs to someone else as our own is called theft. 

If we keep being possessive about things that are meant for someone else, we’d be unfit to attain the ultimate goal. We would end up suffering guilt as well.

This is elaborated in the following Shloka:
