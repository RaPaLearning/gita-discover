## 4-38


```shloka-sa

न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशम् पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।
तत्स्वयम् योगसम्सिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥ ३८ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

na hi jJAnena sadRzam pavitramiha vidyate |
tatsvayam yogasamsiddhaH kAlenAtmani vindati || 38 ||

```
`न विद्यते इह` `[na vidyate iha]` There is nothing in this world, `ज्ञानेन सदृशम्` `[jJAnena sadRzam]` which is equal to knowledge `पवित्रम्` `[pavitram]` in its flawlessness. `योगसम्सिद्धः` `[yogasamsiddhaH]` A person who has attained maturity by working without being driven by attachments `तत् विन्दति` `[tat vindati]` will find that knowledge `आत्मनि स्वयम्` `[Atmani svayam]` in his own Self, `कालेन` `[kAlena]` over time.

There is nothing else in this world that’s similar to the knowledge of the Self. It is unmatched in its purity or in its power to purify. In this way, the knowledge of the Self will destroy all wrongs. Having accomplished the practice of working every single day without being driven by attachments - as described before – over time, a person automatically obtains this knowledge in his own Self.

In the next Shloka, the Lord describes the same concept in a more elaborate manner.
