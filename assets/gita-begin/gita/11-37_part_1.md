```shloka-sa

कस्मात् च ते न नमेरन् महात्मन्
गरीयसे ब्रह्मणोऽप्यादिकर्त्रे ।

```
```shloka-sa-hk

kasmAt ca te na nameran mahAtman
garIyase brahmaNo'pyAdikartre |

```
`महात्मन्` `[mahAtman]` Lord, `कस्मात्` `[kasmAt]` why `न नमेरन्` `[na nameran]` would anyone not bow `ते` `[te]` to You? `आदिकर्त्रे` `[Adikartre]` You are the origin `ब्रह्मणः अपि` `[brahmaNaH api]` of Brahma himself, the principal engineer of this universe, `गरीयसे` `[garIyase]` towering over everything else.

Lord, why would anyone not bow to You, the origin of Brahma himself, the principal engineer of the universe, when You tower over everything else?
