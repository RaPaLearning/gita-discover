`योगी` `[yogI]` Such a person, who works without being driven by desire `आत्मानम् युन्जीत` `[AtmAnam yunjIta]` must meditate on the true nature of the Self `सततम्` `[satatam]` daily `रहसि स्थितः` `[rahasi sthitaH]` in a place that is not public, `एकाकी` `[ekAkI]` being by himself, `यतचित्तात्मा` `[yatacittAtmA]` keeping his mind and intellect under control, `निराशीः` `[nirAzIH]` not being interested in anything else `अपरिग्रहः` `[aparigrahaH]` and not giving into possessiveness.

Such a person, who is focused on 
[working without being driven](2-40.md#karmayoga)
 is instructed to bring the Self into focus at a given time daily, when he contemplates its true nature. While doing this, he is situated in a place that’s quiet, without the company of a second person. 

He controls his mind and intellect, not being interested in anything except the Self, not falling for any feelings of possessiveness.
