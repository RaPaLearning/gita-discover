`भारत` `[bhArata]` Arjuna, `सर्वस्य` `[sarvasya]` each person's `श्रद्धा` `[zraddhA]` focus `सत्वानुरूपा भवति` `[satvAnurUpA bhavati]` is according to the essence of his character. `अयम् पुरुषः` `[ayam puruSaH]` This person is `श्रद्धामयः` `[zraddhAmayaH]` defined by his focus. `यः` `[yaH]` Whoever `यत् श्रद्धः` `[yat zraddhaH]` has a focus, `स एव सः` `[sa eva saH]` he is that itself.

[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. In this way, focus is born on a subject based on the qualities that make up the core of our body.

Here, the phrase 'essence of character' is used to represent our body along with its organs and the mind, as told

[focus](17-2.md#shraddha_focus)
.

The Lord elaborates this very fact next:
