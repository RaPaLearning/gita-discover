```shloka-sa

अवाच्य वादाम्श्च बहून् वदिष्यन्ति तवाहिताः ।
निन्दन्तस्तव सामर्थ्यम् ततो दुःखतरम् नु किम् ॥ ३६ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

avAcya vAdAmzca bahUn vadiSyanti tavAhitAH |
nindantastava sAmarthyam tato duHkhataram nu kim || 36 ||

```
`तव अहिताः` `[tava ahitAH]` Your enemies `निन्दन्तः` `[nindantaH]` will insult `तव सामर्थ्यम्` `[tava sAmarthyam]` your capability `वदिष्यन्ति च` `[vadiSyanti ca]` and they will speak `अवाच्यवादाम्श्च बहून्` `[avAcyavAdAmzca bahUn]` many unspeakable things. `दुःखतरम् किम् नु` `[duHkhataram kim nu]` Indeed, what can be more sorrowful `ततः` `[tataH]` than that?

‘How was this Arjuna able to stand in front of us even for a moment? His strength is only before others’ - Thus, your enemies, the sons of Dhritarashtra will speak repeatedly to insult your strength. This is not supposed to be said of valiant people. What could be more sorrowful for you? Indeed, you know that death is better than listening to those words.

As He says in the next Shloka: For a brave warrior, killing enemies or being killed by the enemies - both lead to glory.
