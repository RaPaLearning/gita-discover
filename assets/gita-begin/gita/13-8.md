इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यम् अनहंकार एव च ।
जन्म मृत्यु जरा व्याधि दुःख दोषानुदर्शनम् ॥ ८ ॥

`वैराग्यम्` `[vairAgyam]` Without indulging the desire `इन्द्रियार्थेषु` `[indriyArtheSu]` for the enjoyment of our organs, `अनहंकार` `[anahaMkAra]` without the misconception that the body is the Self, `अनुदर्शनम्` `[anudarzanam]` considering `दुःख दोष` `[duHkha doSa]` that flaws and sorrows `जन्म मृत्यु जरा व्याधि` `[janma mRtyu jarA vyAdhi]` such as birth, death, old age and disease are inevitable consequences of the body.

Considering that the enjoyment of our organs is unrelated to the realization of the Self; that it is tainted with flaws, staying away from them; 

Without the misconception that the body is the Self – not only the body, this applies to any other entity that can be confused with the Self; 

Events that cause sorrow - such as death and disease - are inevitable as long as we are associated with our body.
