```shloka-sa

ईश्वरोऽहम् अहम् भोगी सिद्धोहम् बलवान् सुखी ॥ १४ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

Izvaro'ham aham bhogI siddhoham balavAn sukhI || 14 ||

```
`ईश्वरः अहम्` `[IzvaraH aham]` 'I am the boss. `अहम् भोगी` `[aham bhogI]` I enjoy all this. `सिद्धः अहम्` `[siddhaH aham]` Single-handed, I accomplish. `बलवान्` `[balavAn]` I am powerful. `सुखी` `[sukhI]` I am happy'.

'I am the boss' - I am answerable to myself, I'm the one who controls others too. 'I enjoy all this' - I accumulate and enjoy all this by myself, not with something that's not perceptible.

'Single-handed, I accomplish' - I accomplish my goals on my own, without any imperceptible factors. Further, I am powerful by myself. I am happy by myself.
