`तु` `[tu]` Further, `ये` `[ye]` those who `माम् उपासते` `[mAm upAsate]` worship Me, `ध्यायन्त` `[dhyAyanta]` recollecting Me `संन्यस्य` `[saMnyasya]` by dedicating `सर्वाणि कर्माणि` `[sarvANi karmANi]` all activity `मयि` `[mayi]` in Me - `मत्पराः` `[matparAH]` they have Me as their ultimate goal. `अनन्येन एव योगेन` `[ananyena eva yogena]` Their only motivation is to unite with Me.
`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `अहम्` `[aham]` I am `तेशाम्` `[tezAm]` their `समुद्धर्ता` `[samuddhartA]` savior `सागरात्` `[sAgarAt]` from the sea `मृत्यु सम्सार` `[mRtyu samsAra]` of perishable material. `मयि आवेशित चेतसाम्` `[mayi Avezita cetasAm]` For those who place their consciousness in Me, `भवामि न चिरात्` `[bhavAmi na cirAt]` I’m with them instantly.

> Deciphering the Self is tough. Entrust yourself to the Lord – He accepts you directly.



The whole material world engages in activity. Activities such as eating are material activities, which are needed to sustain everyone’s journey in their body. Then there are activities prescribed to everyone - such as charity, rituals and meditation. 

Those who dedicate all these activities to Me are the people who worship Me. They do so along with the dedication of their reasoning and intent. They are conscious about the true nature of the Self, desiring nothing but 
[union with Me](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
, without attachment to other benefits. 

They dedicate their thoughts to me with prayer, praise and worship, considering these activities themselves to be extremely enjoyable. Their performance itself is the benefit.

Without any delay, I will save them from all that prevents them from attaining Me. I will save them from the sea of this material world, which is bound by cycles of death.
