`त्वम् परमम् अक्षरम्` `[tvam paramam akSaram]` You are the supreme and ever-lasting One. `वेदितव्यम्` `[veditavyam]` You are to be known. `त्वम्` `[tvam]` You are `परमम् निधानम्` `[paramam nidhAnam]` the ultimate basis `अस्य विश्वस्य` `[asya vizvasya]` of this universe. `त्वम् अव्ययः` `[tvam avyayaH]` You never wear out, `शाश्वत धर्म गोप्ता` `[zAzvata dharma goptA]` You are the protector of eternal values. `त्वम् सनातनः पुरुषः` `[tvam sanAtanaH puruSaH]` You are the eternal person. `मे मतः` `[me mataH]` This is my belief.

It is stated in the Upanishads that the Lord is to be known and grasped - as stated in 
`मुंदक` `[muMdaka]` , 1-1-4:
 'Two pieces of knowledge are to be known - the material and the superior'. 

In this Shloka, Arjuna says to Krishna - 'The One who is mentioned in the Upanishads as the supreme, ever-lasting person is You. You are the ultimate basis of this universe. You do not wear out. Whatever Your form, qualities and all-pervasive natures are, You always stay that way. 

You protect the eternal and constant values laid down in the scriptures. You do that through incarnations such as this one. You are the ever-lasting person mentioned in scriptures such as the 
`पुरुष सूक्त` `[puruSa sUkta]` :
 'I know this great person' and the 
`मुंदक उपनिशत्` `[muMdaka upanizat]` , 3-2-8:
 'The person who is superior to all that's superior'. You are definitely the One - this is my firm belief. 

Krishna, I have realized You in this form'.
