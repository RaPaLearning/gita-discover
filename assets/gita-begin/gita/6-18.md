यदा विनियतम् चित्तम् आत्मन्येव अवतिष्ठते ।
निःस्पृहः सर्व कामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा ॥ १८ ॥

```
`यदा` `[yadA]` When `चित्तम्` `[cittam]` a person’s consciousness `अवतिष्ठते` `[avatiSThate]` stays `विनियतम्` `[viniyatam]` firm `आत्मनि एव` `[Atmani eva]` in the Self alone, `निःस्पृहः` `[niHspRhaH]` without attachments `सर्व कामेभ्यः` `[sarva kAmebhyaH]` towards any desires, `तदा` `[tadA]` then `युक्तः इत्युच्यते` `[yuktaH ityucyate]` the person is said to be focused and deserves to realize the Self.

The consciousness is by nature looking for benefits and outcomes. When it is stationed firmly in the Self, it is turned towards the ultimate benefit (
[moksha](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
) and thus stays focused, unmoved. When this happens, the person stands free of attachment towards all desires. 

He is said to have the focus and deserves to realize the Self.
