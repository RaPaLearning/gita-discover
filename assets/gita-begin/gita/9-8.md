प्रकृतिम् स्वाम् अवष्टभ्य विसृजामि पुनः पुनः ।
भूत ग्रामम् इमम् कृत्स्नम् अवशम् प्रकृतेर्वशात् ॥ ८ ॥

```
`विसृजामि` `[visRjAmi]` I create `इमम् कृत्स्नम्` `[imam kRtsnam]` this entire `भूत ग्रामम्` `[bhUta grAmam]` system of beings `पुनः पुनः` `[punaH punaH]` again and again, `प्रकृतिम् स्वम् अवष्टभ्य` `[prakRtim svam avaSTabhya]` while keeping My material nature as the basis. `प्रकृतेर्वशात्` `[prakRtervazAt]` Under the influence of the material world, `अवशम्` `[avazam]` they are not free.

I create the various beings repeatedly over time, in the four forms of 
[gods](4-12.md#gods_and_other_powers)
, humans, other animals and non-mobile beings, keeping My material nature as the basis. This material nature has varied forms and manifests in eight ways (see [7-4](7-4.md)). It is rich in the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 and is very attractive. All types of beings are under the influence of this material world. Hence, they are deprived of freedom.

Now, you may doubt: If The Lord is so inconsiderate as to perform His act of creation in this way, doesn't this merciless behavior tarnish Him in any way? The next Shloka resolves this question.
