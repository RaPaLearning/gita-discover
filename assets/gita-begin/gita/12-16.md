`मद्भक्तः` `[madbhaktaH]` A devotee of Mine `अनपेक्षः` `[anapekSaH]` doesn’t expect anything. `उदासीनः` `[udAsInaH]` He is neutral, `शुचिः` `[zuciH]` clean `दक्षः` `[dakSaH]` and diligent. `गतव्यथः` `[gatavyathaH]` He is without agitation, `सर्वारम्भ परित्यागी` `[sarvArambha parityAgI]` leaving the notion that he makes everything 
[happen](14-19.md#happenings) - `यः` `[yaH]` such a person `स मे प्रियः` `[sa me priyaH]` is dear to Me.

My devotee has no expectation in anything other than the Self. He is clean, sustaining his body as per the rules laid down in the scriptures. He is diligent in his duties. He isn't worn out by cold, heat and other harsh experiences, which are unavoidable while discharging his duties. He remains neutral when subject to such experiences. 

He doesn’t start any endeavor that is not part of his duty to worship Me. 

Such a person is dear to Me.
