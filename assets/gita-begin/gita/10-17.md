`अहम्` `[aham]` I `योगी` `[yogI]` am in the quest of Your 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
. `कथम् विद्याम्` `[katham vidyAm]` How do I know You, `परिचिन्तयन् सदा` `[paricintayan sadA]` while thinking about You always? `भगवन्` `[bhagavan]` O Lord, `केषु केषु च भावेषु` `[keSu keSu ca bhAveSu]` in what forms and thoughts `चिन्त्यो असि` `[cintyo asi]` are You to be thought about `मया` `[mayA]` by Me?

I am in the quest of Your 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
. Being in this quest, I have You in My thoughts always, I think of You with 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
. While thinking of You in this way, how do I know You completely, along with everything that's Yours? 

Other than the reasoning, knowledge and states-of-being You described 
[previously](10-4_to_10-5.md)
, in what ways should I think of You as the governor of the Universe - Ways that haven’t been described till now?
