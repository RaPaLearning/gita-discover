```shloka-sa

न रूपम् अस्येह तथोपलभ्यते 
नान्तो न चाऽदिः न च सम्प्रतिष्ठा ।

```
```shloka-sa-hk

na rUpam asyeha tathopalabhyate 
nAnto na cA'diH na ca sampratiSThA |

```
`इह` `[iha]` Over here, `अस्य रूपम्` `[asya rUpam]` the form of this tree `न उपलभ्यते` `[na upalabhyate]` is not apparent `तथा` `[tathA]` in the manner described before. `न अन्तः` `[na antaH]` We cannot see its end, `न च आदिः` `[na ca AdiH]` its beginning, `न च सम्प्रतिष्ठा` `[na ca sampratiSThA]` or the basis for its continued existence.

In the previous Shloka, the material world was described as a tree. Its roots represent Brahma, the principal engineer, at the top. Its branches below represent various generations of the human world. 

Its branches have further spread upwards and downwards based on the activities of humans. This form of the material world is not apparent to people who are bound in it. Mere facts are apparent to us, such as 'I am a human', 'I am born to my parents', 'I am the parent of my children' and 'I transact and experience the world accordingly'.

We cannot see its end either - it's not apparent that this tree is cut off by the absence of attachment towards material experiences. Attachments are full of the 
[three qualities](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
. It is not apparent that ignorance is the basis of its continued existence. Ignorance is the consideration that our body is the Self.
