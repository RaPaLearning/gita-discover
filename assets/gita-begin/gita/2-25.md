`अयम्` `[ayam]` This Self `अव्यक्तः` `[avyaktaH]` cannot be distinguished by experiences of the sense organs. `अयम् अचिन्त्यः` `[ayam acintyaH]` It cannot be realized via any thought process. `अयम् अविकार्यः उच्यते` `[ayam avikAryaH ucyate]` It is said to be of unchanging form. `तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` Thus, `एनम् विदित्वा` `[enam viditvA]` knowing this fact, `अनुशोचितुम् न अर्हसि` `[anuzocitum na arhasi]` you don’t need to feel any sorrow for the Self.

The Self is not experienced with the kind of 'proof of existence', using which we experience sensory objects. Unlike material objects, the Self cannot be split into parts either. It cannot be understood in terms of things that we can sense. 

The Self is distinct from all the objects we experience. The Self cannot be deduced by thought either: Since it is distinct from everything we experience, we cannot think about it in terms of any material characteristics. The Self is not subject to any change of form.

With the knowledge of the Self as explained above, you don’t need to feel sorrow for it.
