# Chapter 14


In the 13th chapter, the characteristics of the Self and the environment were described, along with their association. Then, several 
[virtues](13-7.md#virtues_amanitvam)
 were listed, such as being without a sense of superiority. These virtues help in realizing the Self. 

With these virtues, 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 and the Lord's compassion, a person is 
[freed](Back-to-Basics.md#Moksha)
 from material bonds. 

The cause of the bond with the material world was also stated - the bond is due to our desires, such as our craving for happiness. The 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 soak the desires of the material world with their influence. This was told in [13-21](13-21_first_part.md): 'The Self is bound to the environment due to its association with the 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 in births that came from virtue and flaws'.

Next, in this chapter, the Lord describes the way in which these 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 bind us, along with the method to gain freedom from these 
[qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
.
