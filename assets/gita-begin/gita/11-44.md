`तस्मात्` `[tasmAt]` That's why `अहम्` `[aham]` I `त्वाम् प्रसादये` `[tvAm prasAdaye]` please You with worship, `प्रणम्य` `[praNamya]` by bowing to You `कायम् प्रणिधाय` `[kAyam praNidhAya]` and laying my body at Your feet. `ईशम्` `[Izam]` You are the ultimate controller, `ईड्यम्` `[IDyam]` You are to be praised. `देव` `[deva]` Lord, `पितेव` `[piteva]` Just as a father tolerates `पुत्रस्य` `[putrasya]` his son's flaws, `सखेव` `[sakheva]` just as a friend tolerates `सख्युः` `[sakhyuH]` a friend's flaws, `प्रियः` `[priyaH]` You are affectionate `सोढुम् अर्हसि` `[soDhum arhasi]` and can definitely tolerate the same, `प्रियाय` `[priyAya]` in Your love for me.

You are the father of everything, the mentor, teacher, the most revered and the greatest in compassion and other such qualities. You are the controller of everything and are to be praised. I gladden You by bowing to You and laying My body in Your surrender. 

A father or a friend pardons when requested with humility, even if the son or friend has committed offence. In the same way, You can definitely pardon the offences I have committed- You have the greatest compassion and are very affectionate towards Me.
