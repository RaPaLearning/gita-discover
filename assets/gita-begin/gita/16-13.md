इदम् अद्य मया लब्धम् इमम् प्राप्स्ये मनोरथम् ।
इदम् अस्तीदमपि मे भविष्यति पुनर्धनम् ॥ १३ ॥

idam adya mayA labdham imam prApsye manoratham |
idam astIdamapi me bhaviSyati punardhanam || 13 ||

```
`अद्य` `[adya]` 'Today, `इदम्` `[idam]` all this `लब्धम्` `[labdham]` is attained `मया` `[mayA]` by me'; `प्राप्स्ये` `[prApsye]` 'I will get `इमम् मनोरथम्` `[imam manoratham]` whatever I desire'; `इदम् धनम्` `[idam dhanam]` 'All this wealth `अस्ति` `[asti]` exists `इदम् अपि पुनः भविष्यति` `[idam api punaH bhaviSyati]` and will continue to be acquired `मे` `[me]` for me'.

People who disregard the Lord's instructions believe that all their possessions - a piece of land, a family or a son - are acquired by their own capability. Their belief is - 'Everything that I achieve is by my ability, not by anything that I can't perceive. Desires are fulfilled by me, not with anything imperceptible. Wealth is got by my capability - it exists for me. Also, I acquire wealth in future by my capability alone'.
