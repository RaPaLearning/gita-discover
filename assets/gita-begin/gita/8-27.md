## 8-27


```shloka-sa

नैते सृती पार्थ जानन् योगी मुह्यति कश्चन ।
तस्मात् सर्वेषु कालेषु योगयुक्तो भव अर्जुन ॥ २७ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

naite sRtI pArtha jAnan yogI muhyati kazcana |
tasmAt sarveSu kAleSu yogayukto bhava arjuna || 27 ||

```
`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `कश्चन` `[kazcana]` any `जानन् योगी` `[jAnan yogI]` devotee who practices 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
 and knows `एते सृती` `[ete sRtI]` these paths `न मुह्यति` `[na muhyati]` will not get bewildered. `तस्मात् अर्जुन` `[tasmAt arjuna]` Hence, Arjuna, `योग युक्तो` `[yoga yukto]` be with 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being) `सर्वेषु कालेषु` `[sarveSu kAleSu]` at all times.

Any devotee who knows these two paths will not get confused at the time of leaving this world. Instead of being deluded at the time of death, he chooses to go on the path prescribed to him - the 
[path of luster](8-22.md#archiradi_dhumadi)
. Hence, be with the knowledge of the 
[path of luster](8-22.md#archiradi_dhumadi)
 and keep thinking about it. 

The Lord illustrated many concepts in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8. In the next Shloka, He describes the benefit of knowing these concepts.
