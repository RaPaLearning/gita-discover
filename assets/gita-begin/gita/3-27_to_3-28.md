`अहङ्कार विमूढात्मा` `[ahaGkAra vimUDhAtmA]` A person who, due to ignorance, thinks of his body as himself, `इति मन्यते` `[iti manyate]` keeps telling himself - `कर्ता अहम्` `[kartA aham]` I am the doer `कर्माणि सर्वशः` `[karmANi sarvazaH]` of all actions - `प्रकृतेः गुणैः क्रियमाणानि` `[prakRteH guNaiH kriyamANAni]` while these actions are actually an effect of the 
[qualities of nature](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
.
`हे महाबाहो` `[he mahAbAho]` Arjuna, `तत्त्व वित्तु` `[tattva vittu]` the person who knows the factual `गुणकर्म विभागयोः` `[guNakarma vibhAgayoH]` distinctions among 
[qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 and actions `न सज्जते` `[na sajjate]` is not attached to them, `इति मत्वा` `[iti matvA]` since he believes that `गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्ते` `[guNA guNeSu vartante]` the 
[qualities of nature](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 will anyway make the corresponding actions happen.

A person who is confused about the Self keeps telling himself ‘I do my actions’, whenever the 
[three qualities of nature](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
 make 
[these actions happen](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
. Such confusion comes to a person when he thinks of himself as his body, instead of recognizing the Self inside. Without knowing the Self, he believes that he’s the one who 
[makes things happen](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
 in the environment. 

Activity in the environment is an effect of the 
[three qualities of nature](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
: sattva (wisdom, virtue, truth), rajas (passion, emotion: cause of great activity) and tamas (ignorance, darkness). When a person can distinguish these 
[three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 and their 
[effects](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
, he realizes that those qualities will make their effects happen anyway. When he recognizes that he’s not the one who 
[makes things happen](Back-to-Basics.md#actions_and_happenings)
, he doesn’t get attached to them.
