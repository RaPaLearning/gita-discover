अश्रद्दधानाः पुरुषाः धर्मस्य अस्य परन्तप ।
अप्राप्य माम् निवर्तन्ते मृत्यु सम्सार वर्त्मनि ॥ ३ ॥

`परन्तप` `[parantapa]` O destroyer of enemies, `पुरुषाः` `[puruSAH]` people `अश्रद्दधानाः` `[azraddadhAnAH]` who do not believe in `अस्य धर्मस्य` `[asya dharmasya]` this practice `माम् अप्राप्य` `[mAm aprApya]` don’t attain Me. `निवर्तन्ते` `[nivartante]` They return `मृत्यु सम्सार वर्त्मनि` `[mRtyu samsAra vartmani]` to this material world, which is always subject to death and destruction.

I am the focus of this virtue called service and 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
. I am adored beyond any comparison. In this way, this virtue is also superlative - it is excellence in its ultimate form. It is a means to achieve Me. People are capable of practicing it. 

Even though they are capable, those who don't believe in its practice - those who don't trust it and don't have the urge to follow it - will not attain Me. They continue to remain in this material world, characterized by cycles of death and destruction. 

It's indeed incredible that people still don't believe in its practice! That is the opinion expressed here. 

Now listen to My greatness. It is meant to be attained, even though it cannot be grasped by thought.
