`अपि` `[api]` Even `जिज्ञासुः` `[jijJAsuH]` a person who wants to know `योगस्य` `[yogasya]` the nature of 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being) `अतिवर्तते` `[ativartate]` will overcome `शब्दब्रह्म` `[zabdabrahma]` the influence of material stimuli.

Even when a person is not yet in the state called 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
, as long as he wants to know the path to realize the Self, he will be led by the aspiration to gain that realization. In this way, he accomplishes the realization of the Self by means of his 
[activity](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
. 

With this accomplishment, he overcomes the influence of the material world. 

The ‘material world’ consists of various forms that we call by names such as humans, animals, earth, sky, gods and heavens. A person who is beyond the limitations imposed by the material world realizes the Self. The Self has a form that is nothing but knowledge and infinite joy. It does not deserve to be called by names such as human or god.
