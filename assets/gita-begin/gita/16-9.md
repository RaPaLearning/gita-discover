`अवष्टभ्य` `[avaSTabhya]` Staying `एताम् दृष्टिम्` `[etAm dRSTim]` with these opinions, `नष्टात्मानः` `[naSTAtmAnaH]` they lose the Self `अल्प बुद्धयः` `[alpa buddhayaH]` and diminish in intellect. `अहिताः` `[ahitAH]` They are a nuisance, `उग्रकर्माणः` `[ugrakarmANaH]` doing things that hurt others. `प्रभवन्ति` `[prabhavanti]` They become `क्षयाय` `[kSayAya]` the decay `जगतः` `[jagataH]` of the world.

People who disregard the Lord's instructions stay in their opinion - they do not recognize their Self, which is separate from their body and is not perceived. 

Their intellect is diminished - they are unable to distinguish the Self from the body. They don’t perceive the body as we perceive a pot or other inanimate materials. They do not realize that the Self is the power to know.

They do things that hurt others - they trouble everyone and become the decay in everything.
