अक्षराणाम् अकारोऽस्मि द्वन्द्वः सामासिकस्य च ।
अहम् एव अक्षयः कालो धाताहम् विश्वतो मुखः ॥ ३३ ॥

`अक्षराणाम्` `[akSarANAm]` In alphabets, `अकारः अस्मि` `[akAraH asmi]` I am the primary element, the phonetic 'a'. `सामासिकस्य` `[sAmAsikasya]` Among the various methods of combining words, `द्वन्द्वः` `[dvandvaH]` I am the dvandva. `अहम् एव` `[aham eva]` I alone am `अक्षयः कालः` `[akSayaH kAlaH]` the time that never wanes. `धाता अहम्` `[dhAtA aham]` I am the One who brought about all creation, `विश्वतः मुखः` `[vizvataH mukhaH]` having four heads, looking over all of My creation.

In alphabets, the phonetic 'a' is inside all speech, as said in the scriptures. I am this sound 'a', which is the basis for all sounds.

Among the various ways of combining words, I am the 'dvandva' variety. It's the only one that joins two words while enhancing the prominence of both of them - that is the specialty of dvandva. 

I am the time that never wanes, having an endless sequence of appointments and happenings. 

I am Hiranyagarbha, the four-faced engineer of the Universe who executed all of creation.
