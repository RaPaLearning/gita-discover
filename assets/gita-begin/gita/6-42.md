```
`अथवा` `[athavA]` A person who slipped after going further on the path to realize the Self `भवव्ति` `[bhavavti]` is born `कुले` `[kule]` to a family `धीमताम्` `[dhImatAm]` of wise people who are capable of teaching, `योगिनामेव` `[yoginAmeva]` and who themselves practice the realization of the Self. `यत् ईदृशम् जन्म` `[yat IdRzam janma]` This type of birth `एतत् दुर्लभतरम् हि` `[etat durlabhataram hi]` is extremely rare and difficult to get `लोके` `[loke]` in this world.

When a person's realization of the Self has progressed to become mature and he slips from the path of 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
, he is born in a great and wise family whose members themselves practice 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
 and are capable of teaching this to others. 

These two types of births – in a family of people who are capable of yoga and among people who practice it – are extremely rare for ordinary beings of this world. They are achieved by the greatness of 
[yoga](6-20_to_6-23.md#yoga_state_of_being)
.
