## 2-59


```shloka-sa

विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।
रसवर्जम् रसोप्यस्य परम् दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥ ५९ ॥

```shloka-sa-hk

viSayA vinivartante nirAhArasya dehinaH |
rasavarjam rasopyasya param dRSTvA nivartate || 59 ||

```
`रसवर्जम्` `[rasavarjam]` With the exception of desire, `विषयाः` `[viSayAH]` sensual objects `विनिवर्तन्ते` `[vinivartante]` retreat `देहिनः` `[dehinaH]` from somebody `निराहारस्य` `[nirAhArasya]` who has pulled his sense organs back from those objects. `अस्य` `[asya]` His `रसोऽपि` `[raso'pi]` desire for sensual objects also `निवर्तते` `[nivartate]` goes away `परम् दृष्ट्वा` `[param dRSTvA]` upon seeing the pure form of the Self.

Sense-organs experience sensual objects. Someone who retracts his sense organs from sensual objects will see those experiences retreating from him – that includes all experiences that can retreat. The desire for sensory objects is an exception. It remains without retreating.

Even this desire retreats upon seeing the nature of the Self. The experience of the Self is superior to any happiness provided by our sense organs.
