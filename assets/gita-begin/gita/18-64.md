## 18-64


```shloka-sa

सर्व गुह्यतमम् भूयः शृणु मे परमम् वचः ।
इष्टोऽसि मे धृढम् इति ततो वक्ष्यामि ते हितम् ॥ ६४ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

sarva guhyatamam bhUyaH zRNu me paramam vacaH |
iSTo'si me dhRDham iti tato vakSyAmi te hitam || 64 ||

```
`शृणु` `[zRNu]` Listen `भूयः` `[bhUyaH]` once more `परमम्` `[paramam]` to this supreme `वचः` `[vacaH]` directive `मे` `[me]` of mine, `गुह्यतमम्` `[guhyatamam]` the most subtle `सर्व` `[sarva]` of all. `इति वक्ष्यामि` `[iti vakSyAmi]` I state this `ते हितम्` `[te hitam]` for your benefit, `ततो` `[tato]` since `धृढम् इष्टोऽसि` `[dhRDham iSTo'si]` you are very dear `मे` `[me]` to Me.

Among all these secrets, 
[devotion](Chapter_7.md#bhakti_a_defn)
 is superior. 

Even earlier, it was referred to as 'extremely concealed' in [9-1](9-1.md): 'You are not jealous. I will tell you this knowledge, which is extremely concealed'. 

Listen to that instruction once again from Me. It's My supreme and final directive. I state this for your benefit, since you are very dear to Me.
