```shloka-sa

कर्मजम् बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलम् त्यक्त्वा मनीषिणः ।
जन्म बन्ध विनिर्मुक्ताः पदम् गच्छन्त्यनामयम् ॥ ५१ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

karmajam buddhiyuktA hi phalam tyaktvA manISiNaH |
janma bandha vinirmuktAH padam gacchantyanAmayam || 51 ||

```
`मनीषिणः बुद्धियुक्ता हि` `[manISiNaH buddhiyuktA hi]` Only people who work with the awareness of the Self `कर्मजम् फलम् त्यक्त्वा` `[karmajam phalam tyaktvA]` aren’t limited by the outcome of their actions. `जन्म बन्ध विनिर्मुक्ताः` `[janma bandha vinirmuktAH]` They are freed from the bonds of this birth `गच्छन्ति` `[gacchanti]` and reach `अनामयम् पदम्` `[anAmayam padam]` a state that is free of flaws.

People who work with the awareness of the Self involve in activity, while letting their outcomes go. By working that way, they reach a state that is free of fault. They get freedom from all limitations imposed by birth. This is the predominant message in all the Upanishads.
