`अर्जुन` `[arjuna]` Arjuna, `किम्` `[kim]` what's `बहुना` `[bahunA]` further elaboration `एतेन ज्ञानेन` `[etena jJAnena]` of this knowledge `तव` `[tava]` to you? `अहम्` `[aham]` I `विष्टभ्य` `[viSTabhya]` support and control `इदम्` `[idam]` this `कृत्स्नम् जगत्` `[kRtsnam jagat]` entire universe, `एकाम्शेन स्थितः` `[ekAmzena sthitaH]` which is situated in one part of My being.

What's the need to elaborate this knowledge I speak about? With a miniscule portion of My unbounded control, I pervade everything. Accordingly, the entire universe does not step outside My will - including everything in it, conscious and non-conscious. 

I pervade them in every state - in the state of being a raw material or a finished product, being perceptible or imperceptible, in all their different forms, in steadfastness and in action to change.

As stated in 
`विश्णु पुराण` `[vizNu purANa]` , 1-9-53
 by Parashara: One characteristic of the Lord is the ability to control without boundaries. One part of this unbounded control - the part is also unbounded - has the ability to pervade and control the entire universe inside it.
