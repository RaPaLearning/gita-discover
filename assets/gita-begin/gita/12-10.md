`असमर्थः असि` `[asamarthaH asi]` If you aren’t able `अपि अभ्यासे` `[api abhyAse]` to practice as well, `भव` `[bhava]` be a person `मत्कर्म परमः` `[matkarma paramaH]` who works for Me. `सिद्धिम् अवाप्स्यसि` `[siddhim avApsyasi]` You will attain the goal `कुर्वन्` `[kurvan]` by doing `कर्माणि` `[karmANi]` your actions `मदर्थम्` `[madartham]` for Me.

Even if you’re unable to practice My thoughts, be a person who works for Me. Do all activities out of great love for Me, whether it is construction of temples, gardens, lighting lamps, sweeping, sprinkling water, mopping, offering flowers, conducting prayers, chanting the name of the Lord, traversing a circumference around Him or bowing respectfully. 

By doing everything out of great love for Me, you quickly gain the practice of being in My thought. You will station your consciousness in Me and reach the goal of
