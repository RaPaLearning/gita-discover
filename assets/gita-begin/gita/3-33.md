`ज्ञानवानपि` `[jJAnavAnapi]` Even a knowledgeable person `चेष्टते` `[ceSTate]` behaves `स्वस्याः प्रकृतेः सदृशम्` `[svasyAH prakRteH sadRzam]` according to his 
[nature](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
. `भूतानि` `[bhUtAni]` All beings `प्रकृतिम् यान्ति` `[prakRtim yAnti]` follow their 
[respective natures](14-22.md#satva_rajas_tamas_effects)
. `निग्रहः किम् करिष्यति` `[nigrahaH kim kariSyati]` In this situation, what can restraint do?

Consider a person who knows the scriptures, which describe the Self in a particular way, stating that you must always restrain yourself and focus on the Self. Such a person is also drawn by the influence of actions committed in the past. 

That's because all beings that are attached to inanimate matter are drawn by the influence of 
[the three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
. These qualities are the result of deeds committed since eternity. Under such an influence, what can restraint do? Just knowing about ‘restraint’ as prescribed in the scriptures doesn’t help by itself.

Next, it is explained how a person falls under the influence of 
[the three qualities](2-45_to_2-46.md#satva_rajas_tamas)
 and gets trapped.
