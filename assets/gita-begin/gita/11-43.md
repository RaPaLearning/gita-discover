पितासि लोकस्य चराचरस्य
त्वम् अस्य पूज्यः च गुरुः गरीयान् ।
न त्वत्समोऽस्ति अभ्यधिकः कुतोऽन्यो

`त्वम् पितासि` `[tvam pitAsi]` You are the father `अस्य लोकस्य` `[asya lokasya]` of this world `चराचरस्य` `[carAcarasya]` with all its moving and stationary beings, `गरीयान्` `[garIyAn]` You are superior to all. `गुरुः पूज्यः` `[guruH pUjyaH]` As a teacher, You are revered by all. `अप्रतिम प्रभाव` `[apratima prabhAva]` You have unmatched power, `अन्यः नास्ति` `[anyaH nAsti]` There is no other person `त्वत्समः` `[tvatsamaH]` who is equal to You `लोक त्रयो अपि` `[loka trayo api]` in all the three worlds (the entire universe). `अभ्यधिकः कुतः` `[abhyadhikaH kutaH]` How can it even be conceived that anyone is greater than You?

Lord, you have unequalled power! You are the father of this entire universe with all its beings that are capable of moving and that aren't. You are the mentor and teacher of this world. Hence, You are the most revered being in the universe. 

When nobody can match You, how can anyone even be conceived as greater in any world? Other than You, nobody can match You in compassion; or for that matter, in any other quality of Yours - definitely, nobody can be greater.
