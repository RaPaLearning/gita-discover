सिद्धिम् प्राप्तो यथा ब्रह्म तथाप्नोति निबोध मे ।
समासेनैव कौन्तेय निष्ठा ज्ञानस्य या परा ॥ ५० ॥

`कौन्तेय` `[kaunteya]` Arjuna, `तथा यथा` `[tathA yathA]` the way in which `सिद्धिम् प्राप्तः` `[siddhim prAptaH]` a person who has obtained this outcome `आप्नोति` `[Apnoti]` achieves `ब्रह्म` `[brahma]` The Self, `या परा निष्ठा` `[yA parA niSThA]` the ultimate culmination `ज्ञानस्य` `[jJAnasya]` of knowledge - `निबोध` `[nibodha]` know it `समासेन` `[samAsena]` in a concise way `मे` `[me]` from Me.

This outcome of intense meditation is accomplished by 
[working without attachment](Back-to-Basics.md#karmayOga_a_defn)
. It deserves to be practiced everyday till we depart from this body. 

The Lord says 'Know the way in which a person exists and attains the Self. I shall describe it now in a few words'. The specialty of the Self has been told in this Shloka as 'the ultimate culmination of knowledge'. The Self is the ultimate entity attained by knowledge and meditation.
