अहम् हि सर्व यज्ञानाम् भोक्ता च प्रभुरेव च ।

`अहम् हि` `[aham hi]` I am indeed `भोक्ता` `[bhoktA]` the enjoyer `च` `[ca]` and `प्रभुरेव च` `[prabhureva ca]` the single Master `सर्व यज्ञानाम्` `[sarva yajJAnAm]` of all services rendered to anyone or anything. `ते` `[te]` Those who crave for material wealth `न अभिजानन्ति` `[na abhijAnanti]` do not know Me `तत्वेन` `[tatvena]` as I am. `अतः` `[ataH]` Hence, `ते च्यवन्ति` `[te cyavanti]` they fall back.
