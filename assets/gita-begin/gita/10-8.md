`बुधाः` `[budhAH]` People with this awareness `माम् भजन्ते` `[mAm bhajante]` worship Me `इति मत्वा` `[iti matvA]` with the conviction that `अहम् प्रभवः` `[aham prabhavaH]` I am the origin `सर्वस्य` `[sarvasya]` of everything; `सर्वम्` `[sarvam]` that every entity `प्रवर्तते` `[pravartate]` gets stimulated `मत्तः` `[mattaH]` with the initiative given by Me. `भाव समन्विताः` `[bhAva samanvitAH]` These people are filled with feelings of adoration for Me.

The Lord says - 'I am the cause of creation of this whole world with its great variety of different beings, both conscious and non-conscious. 

[Those who know](7-16.md#jnAnI)
 will recognize that every being initiates activity with My stimulation. They have conviction that I have this unlimited power by My very nature; that I have abundant favorable qualities such as affection, beauty and an equitable outlook towards everyone.
