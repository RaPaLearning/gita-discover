`श्री भगवानुवाच` `[zrI bhagavAnuvAca]` The Lord said:
`पार्थ` `[pArtha]` Arjuna, `शृणु` `[zRNu]` listen `तत् यथ` `[tat yatha]` to the way in which `माम् ज्ञास्यसि` `[mAm jJAsyasi]` you will know me `समग्रम्` `[samagram]` entirely `असम्शयम्` `[asamzayam]` without any doubt, `मयि आसक्त मनाः` `[mayi Asakta manAH]` with a mind filled with eagerness towards Me, `योगम् युन्जन्` `[yogam yunjan]` embarking on the journey to join Me, `मदाश्रयः` `[madAzrayaH]` having taken refuge in Me

> Awareness of the Lord’s uniqueness generates affection towards Him.



The Lord continues- The mind focuses on Me with an eagerness that comes from a strong wish to attain Me. As soon as you realize the uniqueness of My great powers, My true nature, My qualities and My activities, you will be swept off your senses by a rush of love towards Me. By this love, you will deeply bind your thoughts in Me.

Then you take refuge in Me - you cannot exist without Me; In this way, I alone am your refuge and the basis for your existence. You will embark on the journey to join me and be of my service. Listen to the knowledge that I am going to tell you with an attentive mind. After I tell this, you will know Me entirely without any doubt.
