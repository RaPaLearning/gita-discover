`ओम् तत् सत् इति` `[om tat sat iti]` 'Om', 'tat', 'sat' are `त्रिविधः निर्देशः` `[trividhaH nirdezaH]` three specific directives, `ब्रह्मणः स्मृतः` `[brahmaNaH smRtaH]` prescribed for all activities in the Lord's scriptures. `वेदाः` `[vedAH]` The Vedas, `ब्राह्मणाः` `[brAhmaNAH]` people in the quest for the Lord `यज्ञाः च` `[yajJAH ca]` and the way of worship `विहिताः` `[vihitAH]` were specified `पुरा` `[purA]` long ago `तेन` `[tena]` with these sounds.

The word 
`ब्रह्म` `[brahma]`
 here refers to the activities specified by the Lord. 'Om', 'tat' and 'sat' are three sounds that give direction when they are applied to worship, discipline and charity in the scriptures.

> The sound of ‘Om’ points to a higher purpose.



The sound 'Om' is a component of every work prescribed by the Lord in the Vedas. It is chanted at the start of an endeavor. The other two words 'tat' and 'sat' come from an expression of admiration. 

In this shloka, the Lord stated that the Vedas, the people who practice them and the forms of worship were established long ago by Him - along with the application of ‘Om’, ‘tat’ and ‘sat’ directives. Next, The Lord illustrates the way in which the sounds of 'Om', 'tat' and 'sat' associate. First, He states the way in which the sound of 'Om' applies.
