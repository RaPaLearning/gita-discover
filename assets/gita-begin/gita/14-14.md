```shloka-sa

यदा सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे तु प्रलयम् याति देहभृत् ।
तदा उत्तम विदाम् लोकान् अमलान् प्रतिपद्यते ॥ १४ ॥

```
```shloka-sa-hk

yadA sattve pravRddhe tu pralayam yAti dehabhRt |
tadA uttama vidAm lokAn amalAn pratipadyate || 14 ||

```
`यदा` `[yadA]` When `देहभृत्` `[dehabhRt]` an owner of a body `प्रलयम् याति` `[pralayam yAti]` is resorbed `सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे` `[sattve pravRddhe]` in a predominance of 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
, `तदा` `[tadA]` then `प्रतिपद्यते` `[pratipadyate]` he proceeds to `अमलान् लोकान्` `[amalAn lokAn]` unspoilt communities `उत्तम विदाम्` `[uttama vidAm]` with supreme knowledge.

When a person encounters death - when the body is resorbed with 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
 being predominant, the Self proceeds to a world where awareness is experienced. Such a world has communities that know the true nature of the Self. They are unspoilt by ignorance. 

Having died at a time when 
[sattva](14-6.md#sattva)
 is predominant, this person is re-born in a community of people who realize the Self. He works in accordance with that birth. His actions lead to the realization of the Self.
